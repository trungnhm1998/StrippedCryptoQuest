Emma:Bravo! Your Leg! #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_21
Emma:Why is it that color! Is that poison? Are you okay? #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_22
Bravo:I tried to steer clear, but some of it splashed onto my leg! #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_23
Bravo:I'm okay, but it feels like the world is spinning a little bit! #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_24

Bravo:Phew. I'm saved! #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_26
Bravo:This place is filled with poisonous swamps; that's why I couldn't steer clear of them! #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_27
Emma:Couldn't you have taken a detour? #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_28
Bravo:No! This is the only path! Also it's just poison swamps everywhere you go! #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_29
Emma:Then, we should take the shortest route to minimize our exposure to the poison swamps... #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_30

Bravo:Besides the poison, the air quality here isn't great either. #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_31
Bravo:It reminds me of that lake area we visited where I stayed back. #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_32
Emma:Really? Bravo, how are you feeling? #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_33
Bravo:I'm feeling off, but not as bad as back then, so I should be fine! #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_34
Emma:Take it easy, let's proceed cautiously towards the Demon King's castle. #line:ch006_four_jewels_shrine_35
