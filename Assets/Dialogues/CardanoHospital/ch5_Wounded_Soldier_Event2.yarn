Soldier A: Hey! Where's the doctor? #line:ch5soldierevent2_1
Soldier B: The bleeding won't stop. He'll be gone if we don't act quickly! #line:ch5soldierevent2_2
Nurse: I've already sent for him. He should be here any moment... #line:ch5soldierevent2_3
Soldier A: We need to act fast, or he's going to bleed out! #line:ch5soldierevent2_4
Soldier B: Hold on! Help is on the way! #line:ch5soldierevent2_5
Emma: It seems they're struggling to find a medic. Can I help them, {GetPlayerName()}? #line:ch5soldierevent2_6

Soldier A: Seriously? We've got a crisis here, back off! #line:ch5soldierevent2_7
Emma: You're having a hard time getting a doctor to show up, aren't you?  #line:ch5soldierevent2_8
Emma: If it helps, I can use magic to provide immediate first aid and stop the bleeding. #line:ch5soldierevent2_8_2
Soldier A: Wait, you can perform healing spells? #line:ch5soldierevent2_9
Soldier B: Quickly! Please tend to his injuries! #line:ch5soldierevent2_10

Soldier A: I can see the wound closing up... It's working! #line:ch5soldierevent2_12
Soldier B: Thank goodness, this should stabilize him! #line:ch5soldierevent2_13

Emma: ... Okay, the bleeding's stopped. He's not at risk of bleeding out anymore. #line:ch5soldierevent2_14
Emma: This is just a quick fix. If he pushes himself, the wound could open up again. Make sure to get a doctor to check him out later. #line:ch5soldierevent2_15

Soldier A: I'm so relieved... A little more bleeding, and it could've been fatal... #line:ch5soldierevent2_16
Soldier B: His breathing is more stable now... That's a good sign. #line:ch5soldierevent2_17

Soldier A: I apologize for yelling earlier... Thank you for your help. #line:ch5soldierevent2_18
Soldier B: You have our gratitude. You've truly saved him! #line:ch5soldierevent2_19
Emma: You're welcome. Just glad we could help in time. #line:ch5soldierevent2_20
Soldier A: ...... By the way, who exactly are you folks? You seem like travelers. Why did you come to this clinic? #line:ch5soldierevent2_21
Emma: Well, we were hoping to gather some information regarding the Knights... #line:ch5soldierevent2_22

Doctor: Apologies for the wait. I had urgent cases to attend to elsewhere in the village. #line:ch5soldierevent2_23
Emma: Ah, the doctor has arrived. Once he's properly taken care of, let's continue our discussion. #line:ch5soldierevent2_24

Soldier A: It's good to see you awake and alert. The doctor mentioned that while the wounds were deep, thankfully no vital organs or nerves were harmed.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_25
Soldier A:So, it's promising news. #line:ch5soldierevent2_25_2
Soldier B: You're face's color is looking much better. A bit of rest and keeping the wound clean, and you should be on your feet in no time. #line:ch5soldierevent2_26
Wounded Soldier: I owe you all for getting me here safely. Thank you. #line:ch5soldierevent2_27
Wounded Soldier:Perhaps because I was teetering between life and death... I experienced such vivid dreams. #line:ch5soldierevent2_27_2
Wounded Soldier: In my dream, I was navigating through a silent forest at night.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_28
Wounded Soldier: As I moved ahead, I was drawn to a distant light, much like a moth to a flame. Eventually, this path led me to a serene lake. #line:ch5soldierevent2_28_2
Wounded Soldier: In the center of the lake, there was an island emitting a soft glow.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_29
Wounded Soldier: As I looked closer, I recognized faces of friends who had passed away.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_29_2
Wounded Soldier: They seemed at peace, chatting and laughing amongst themselves.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_29_3
Wounded Soldier: I was about to go to the lake too when I heard you guys calling me frantically from behind. #line:ch5soldierevent2_29_4
Wounded Soldier: For a moment, I felt that maybe my dead friends were beckoning me to join them.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_30
Wounded Soldier: The surrounding luminance grew increasingly intense, reminiscent of dawn, until everything was covered in blinding white light...  #line:ch5soldierevent2_30_2
Wounded Soldier: And then, I woke up, right here in this bed. #line:ch5soldierevent2_30_3
Soldier A: It's quite scary... To think you were so close to the other side. #line:ch5soldierevent2_31
Soldier B: I'm so relieved we managed to bring you back in time. #line:ch5soldierevent2_32
Wounded Soldier: It was your voices that called me back here, or I might truly have been gone. #line:ch5soldierevent2_33
Soldier A: Maybe being on the brink does lead to such lucid dreams... teetering between life and death. #line:ch5soldierevent2_34
Wounded Soldier: You could be onto something. The scenery in my dream looked a lot like the lake near the forest where we've been fighting. #line:ch5soldierevent2_35
Wounded Soldier:  Maybe, because of all the life-or-death situations there, my mind connected it to the concept of death and that's why I dreamt about it. #line:ch5soldierevent2_35_2
Emma: It's a relief to see you're okay, mister. #line:ch5soldierevent2_36

Wounded Soldier: Yes, you were the ones who gave me first aid. It saved my life, thank you. I owe you my life. #line:ch5soldierevent2_37
Emma: You're welcome. #line:ch5soldierevent2_38
Emma: Wait a minute, shouldn't you be resting? Don't push yourself too hard. #line:ch5soldierevent2_39
Emma: Please, don't overdo it for our sake. Just lie back and talk to us. #line:ch5soldierevent2_40
Wounded Soldier: With the bleeding stopped and the wound sealed, I feel much better. #line:ch5soldierevent2_41
Wounded Soldier: I'm under the direct command of Knight Commander Leonhardt and have undergone extensive training. #line:ch5soldierevent2_42
Wounded Soldier: I can handle a bit more than the average person, so you don't need to worry. #line:ch5soldierevent2_42_2
Emma: Directly under Knight Commander you say... #line:ch5soldierevent2_43
Wounded Soldier: Is something wrong? #line:ch5soldierevent2_44
Emma: Earlier, I mentioned that we're here to seek some answers from the Knights. #line:ch5soldierevent2_45
Emma: From what the Cardano villagers shared, it seems the Knights have been involved in landslide restorations in the southeast forest.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_46
Emma: We're puzzled as to why the Knights would be taking part in such activities. #line:ch5soldierevent2_46_2

Emma: Sir, you mentioned you report directly to the Knight Commander.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_47
Emma: Typically, someone in your position wouldn't be in the field for such restoration tasks. And those injuries of yours?  #line:ch5soldierevent2_47_2
Emma: They don't resemble anything from restoration work. It looks more like a wound from a weapon. #line:ch5soldierevent2_47_3
Wounded Soldier: Um... About that... #line:ch5soldierevent2_48
Soldier A: What's got you so curious? #line:ch5soldierevent2_49
Soldier A: We appreciate your help in saving him, but as members of the knighthood, there are matters we're cautious to share. #line:ch5soldierevent2_50
Emma: Well... To put it plainly, as I believe the Knight Commander's close aides would be informed.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_51
Emma: Our mission is to defeat a demon, specifically the Demon King, on behalf of Elrod Castle's King.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_51_2
Emma: This here is {GetPlayerName()}, a descendant of the legendary hero. #line:ch5soldierevent2_51_3
Soldier A: Wait. What? You guys are... #line:ch5soldierevent2_52
Soldier B: Is that young man {GetPlayerName()}-Wagner? #line:ch5soldierevent2_53

Wounded Soldier: He does match the description from Commander Leonhardt, and the look of the fellowship...  #line:ch5soldierevent2_54
Wounded Soldier: Oh yeah, that's right... But he appears more ordinary and youthful than I'd imagined. #line:ch5soldierevent2_54_2
Emma: I'm happy you seem convinced. #line:ch5soldierevent2_55
Emma: Now, what's the real situation in the forest near here? It can't just be about a landslide, right?  #line:ch5soldierevent2_56
Emma: We might be able to help if you're honest with us. #line:ch5soldierevent2_56_2
Wounded Soldier: ... That southeast forest? It's now a hotbed for intense battles against powerful demons. #line:ch5soldierevent2_57
Emma: What? #line:ch5soldierevent2_58
Wounded Soldier: Historically, that region was known for spawning unusually powerful demons, and in recent years, their emergence has become frequent. #line:ch5soldierevent2_59
Wounded Soldier:  With the awakening of the Demon King, the onslaught of these mighty demons intensified.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_59_2
Wounded Soldier:  Our Knight Commander's squad was dispatched to combat this threat. #line:ch5soldierevent2_59_3
Emma: So, you lied to the villagers with the landslide story to keep them away from the forest. #line:ch5soldierevent2_60
Wounded Soldier: Exactly. At first, we thought taking out one big group of them would stop the threat. But then,  #line:ch5soldierevent2_61
Wounded Soldier: more and more waves of demons kept coming, turning it into a long, drawn-out battle. #line:ch5soldierevent2_61_2
Wounded Soldier: You mentioned the villagers of Cardano speaking about the landslide... #line:ch5soldierevent2_62
Wounded Soldier: With the region being off-limits for so long, their suspicions are naturally growing. #line:ch5soldierevent2_62_2
Soldier A: Hiding the truth is becoming increasingly difficult, and there are whispers of relocating the villagers to safer places. #line:ch5soldierevent2_63
Emma: We were not aware the situation was deteriorating this badly... #line:ch5soldierevent2_64
Soldier B: While we have a makeshift medical camp in the forest, it's overwhelmed with injured soldiers from the ongoing fight. #line:ch5soldierevent2_65
Soldier B:  Hence, we were directed to bring him to Cardano's clinic immediately for care and recuperation. #line:ch5soldierevent2_65_2
Soldier B: At this rate, even Commander Leonhardt might reach the breaking point. #line:ch5soldierevent2_66
Emma: Considering the situation, we should hurry to assist them. #line:ch5soldierevent2_67

Soldier A: I'll lead you to the entrance of the forest. We have guards stationed there, allowing only members of our Order to pass.  #line:ch5soldierevent2_68
Soldier A:It'll be smoother if I accompany you and clarify the situation. #line:ch5soldierevent2_68_2
Emma: I see, we appreciate it. #line:ch5soldierevent2_69
