Emma: It is very early so I understand if you are still sleepy.  #line:0adda61 
Emma: I wonder what kind of business the king has with you for him to call you to the castle at this hour without telling anyone?  #line:0686a8b 
Emma: Did you do something wrong ...... while I was not looking?   #line:0c9b8f4
