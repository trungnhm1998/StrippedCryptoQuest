Shipmaster: Ahh! Itâ€™s you guys! My shipmaster told me you were really our guests! I'm sorry I kicked you out earlier. #line:shipyardmob1-msg1
Emma: There's no need for an apology, we didn't have any proof on our end either, so it's understandable that there were suspicions. #line:shipyardmob1-msg2
Shipmaster: We'll make you the best boat we can. Just wait till it's ready. #line:shipyardmob1-msg3
Emma: Yeah, We are looking forward to it! #line:shipyardmob1-msg4

-> YES #line:shipyardmob2-msg2
