Bravo: It was always raining around here so I couldn't smell anything and it was all wet and gross #line:ch2misttwsouthlake4
Bravo: so I didn't bother to go near this area, but I didn't know it looked like this. #line:ch2misttwsouthlake5
Bravo: I had no idea there was a lake! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake6

Bravo: I'm good! And you are good! I'm good! I'm good! Don't worry about me! So let’s keep it that way! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake21
-> YES #line:ch2misttwsouthlakeyes
    Bravo: Yeah! I'm going to be of a lot of use to you in the future! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake22
    Bravo: And when I do, you can praise me a lot and pet me a lot! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake23
-> NO #line:ch2misttwsouthlakeno
    Bravo: You're not going to agree?! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake24
    Bravo: You know it's not nice to be mean! What? No! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake25
    Bravo: But if it's too hard or dangerous, shouldn't we push ourselves? #line:ch2misttwsouthlake26
    Bravo: We are a team and we are traveling together! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake27
    Bravo: ....You're not being mean, you're just being nice... Thanks! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake28

Emma: I looked around the area #line:ch2misttwsouthlake30
Emma: and there were all kinds of unusual flowers and mushrooms that I had never seen before #line:ch2misttwsouthlake31
Emma: as if the constant drizzle had changed the ecosystem a bit! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake32
Emma: I thought maybe there's something we could use for medicine #line:ch2misttwsouthlake33
Emma: and we could explore the fog cleared area! What do you think? Sounds fun! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake34
Emma: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's settled! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake35
Emma: Let's look around where the fog has lifted! I'm sure we'll find something unusual! #line:ch2misttwsouthlake36
