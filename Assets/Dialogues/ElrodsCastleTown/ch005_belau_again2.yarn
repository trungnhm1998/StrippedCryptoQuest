Berau: I'm surprised to bump into you in such a bustling city! I've been selling the items from my travels at the local tool shop here. #line:ch005_belau_again2_15

Berau: I sold a lot of my items earlier, so I don't have a huge selection right now... #line:ch005_belau_again2_22
Berau: How about trying this fruit? #line:ch005_belau_again2_23

Berau: Caught off guard? It packs quite a sour punch, right? #line:ch005_belau_again2_25
Berau: ...I apologize for the sudden surprise, but despite its sourness, this fruit is delicious, packed with nutrients, and great for rejuvenation. #line:ch005_belau_again2_26
Berau: ..Whenever I feel drained or overwhelmed by my journey, I snack on this. It always make me feel a bit better. #line:ch005_belau_again2_27
Berau: It doesn't make a huge difference..... But I thought it might lift your spirits, even if just a tad. #line:ch005_belau_again2_28

Berau: So, how about it? Do you feel better? #line:ch005_belau_again2_29
-> YES #line:ch005_belau_again2_30
    Berau: Phew, That's a relief. #line:ch005_belau_again2_31
    Berau: It's heartening to see that even a small snack can make a difference. #line:ch005_belau_again2_32
-> NO #line:ch005_belau_again2_33
    Berau: Oh, that's unfortunate. #line:ch005_belau_again2_34

Berau: Growing up without a family, I've always been on my own. #line:ch005_belau_again2_40
Berau:  So, I might not fully grasp the depth of pain you're feeling from losing someone dear to you. #line:ch005_belau_again2_40_2
Berau: I can't completely relate to everything you're experiencing or offer the exact comfort you might need... #line:ch005_belau_again2_41
Berau: Your journey is so selfless, helping others, while I've mostly been journeying for my own reasons. #line:ch005_belau_again2_42
Berau: Ever since we met, I've seen you as strong, kind, and admirable. You possess qualities I've always wished for... #line:ch005_belau_again2_43
