Emma:So this is Cardano, the desert village! #line:0cd1cf8
Bravo:Whew, it was sure hot on the way here~... #line:0448c93
Emma:Bravo is all furry. Perhaps shifting to a human form might be cooler? #line:07dfc46
Bravo:Is that so? #line:06dd927

Berau:Did you, (PlayerName), just get to the village? #line:06d9d9b
Berau:You look like you've been sweating bullets. I'd suggest grabbing some water, pronto. #line:049feb5
Berau:That desert trek to get here must've been exhausting. #line:0bf9d67
Emma:True... Everyone seemed to struggle with the heat, walking through the sand. A break sounds good right now. #line:042b9bc
Berau:You should stay hydrated. There's a stand selling coconut and other fruit juices nearby. They're really refreshing. #line:029f086
Bravo:Well, I could use a drink right about now... #line:07d0084
Emma:I've always been curious about coconut juice. I'm exicited to give it a try. #line:0728448
