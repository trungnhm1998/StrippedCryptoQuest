Bravo:Yes, that's it! Geez, that flower stinks! Get rid of it! #line:01a242a
Berau:I stumbled upon this around the village. It's named Blotstar, sprouting from a cacti-like plant. #line:0d161d5
Berau:Its distinct, decaying odor lures in insects for pollination. #line:0b3c01f
Berau:People often find its starfish-like appearance odd, but its hue is quite mesmerizing, especially once you grow accustomed to it... #line:07c9cfc
