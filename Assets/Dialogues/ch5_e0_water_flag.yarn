Roman:...Hmm, you've managed to retrieve the legendary sword, but it appears the curse has marred it... #line:ch5_water_flag_1
Scholar:Well, well! This is quite interesting! #line:ch5_water_flag_2
Emma:That's why we were wondering if we could have an exorcism here at the Great Church? #line:ch5_water_flag_3
Roman:Despite the immense holy power of the Great Church, this curse seems too potent to simply dispel. #line:ch5_water_flag_4
Roman:This sword once belonged to the Legendary Hero and the very slayer of the Demon King. Only a truly unique power could stand against such a curse. #line:ch5_water_flag_5
Roman:So, perhaps matching legend with legend is the solution? #line:ch5_water_flag_6
Emma:You're suggesting there's another method? #line:ch5_water_flag_7
Roman:I've come across an ancient text within the Great Church that speaks of the 'Crystal Clear Water'. #line:ch5_water_flag_8
Emma:Crystal Clear Water? But isn't all water clear? #line:ch5_water_flag_9
Roman:The text reads, 'Drink from this serene water, and all impurities shall vanish.' It is the essence that purifies all.' #line:ch5_water_flag_10
Roman:It's said that this water once cured people of mysterious ailments and curses that plagued this continent. It garnered its name for its unparalleled ability to purify and rejuvenate everything to 'crystal clear' clarity. #line:ch5_water_flag_11
Roman:By combining the power of this water with the sacred power of the Great Church in an exorcism ritual, there's a possibility we could lift the curse. #line:ch5_water_flag_12
Emma:Understood... Let's set out in search of this legendary water. #line:ch5_water_flag_13
Roman:Considering its description, it likely exists in a location resembling a lake. And given its storied history of saving many, I'd think it's somewhere known to us, not a completely undiscovered location. #line:ch5_water_flag_14
Emma:Known locations... We should start by marking potential lakes on the map. I believe our search will be swift as there can't be too many options. #line:ch5_water_flag_15

Bravo:How many locations do we need to explore? #line:ch5_water_flag_16

Emma:Umm... Looking at the map, we have a few options... First, there's a lake close to the Lost Forest. Second, a lake situated on an island in the desert continent where the dead is worshipped. Third, although not a lake, there's a spring near the Elrod Castle. These are our best bets for now. If we investigate these sites, chances are we'll find the legendary water in one of them, right? #line:ch5_water_flag_17
Bravo:Alright! With Master leading us, we'll find it in no time! #line:ch5_water_flag_18
