A Man in the Crowd:Oh? I assumed you folks came for our festival. #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_12
A Man in the Crowd:Welcome to Cardano's signature event, the unique Lariat Festival! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_13
Emma:La...Lariat Festival...? #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_14
A Man in the Crowd:Living in a scorching desert, the heat can sometimes become unbearable. #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_15
A Man in the Crowd:Arm-wrestling began as a way for the strong men here to blow off steam. #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_16
A Man in the Crowd:But, simple arm wrestling can feel nerve-wracking and heighten stress, don't you think? #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_17
A Man in the Crowd:We needed something easier to understand! Something that not only showcases strength but also entertains the spectators! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_18
Thus, we turned to a more theatrical display:dazzling lariats. #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_19
Emma:Wo..Woah. #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_20
A Man in the Crowd:Typically, we determine the strongest in our village through this. But this time, there's an unexpected twistâ€”a traveler has joined the fray! And, astonishingly, he's taking down the best one by one! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_21
Emma:Wh...What...? #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_22
A Man in the Crowd:Look over there! The showdown with our reigning champion is about to start! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_23

Spectators:Whoa! He's been thrown clear! It seems no one in the village can match him now! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_25
Man:Hot hot hot! I love this village!! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_26
Man:This is still not enough, this isn't even my full strength! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_27
Man:Who's next? Anyone else think they're tough enough? Anybody strong? #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_28
Man:I'll take on a tiger, a bear, a demon, even a... Hero! Just bring it on! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_29
Emma:What! He just said 'Hero'...Just now! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_30

Man:Hey? Did you just say 'hero'? #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_32
Man:You, the skinny little one over there, you're not claiming to be a 'hero', are you? #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_33

Emma:It can't be... I mean, heroes aren't just wandering around, right? #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_34
Man:...Exactly. You don't just stumble upon a Hero every day... #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_35

Man:Wait, this little kid is a hero? You've got to be joking! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_38
Emma:What?! He is not a kid.....*cough*! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_39
Emma:Actually, I think you have the wrong person! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_40

Man:This is what Jade was holding! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_42
Emma:Ah! Bravo! You idiot! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_43
Bravo:The Fairy who forgot about my master is the fool! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_44
Emma:No, no! I was lying to gauge this guy! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_45
Emma:He gives off a vibe entirely different from the other Four Heavenly Kings we've encountered before! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_46
Bravo:Huh? You should've told me it was a lie! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_47

Emma:Wow! he's starting to laugh so hard! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_50
Man:Seems you truly are a hero! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_51
Man:I find it hard to believe Jade was defeated by useless people like you. #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_52
Man:The Demon Lord has mentioned that heroes have been a thorn in his side for generations! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_53
Man:So, it wouldn't be surprising if the hero was a young one! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_54
Man:I always warned her not to be careless, but... #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_55
Emma:You just said Demon King, so that means.... #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_56
Man:Aye, I'm Topaz. One of the Four Heavenly Kings! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_57
Emma:I knew it, he is one of the Four Heavenly Kings! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_58
Topaz:There's nothing I cherish more than a serious competition! Power is everything! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_59
Topaz:Hey, hero, you have strength, don't you? Let's give it everything we've got. #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_60
Topaz:But remember, no hard feelings... #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_61
Topaz:It's an order from the Demon Lord! You are all to be stabbed and burned to death! #line:ch6_four_heavenly_kings_event_3_62
