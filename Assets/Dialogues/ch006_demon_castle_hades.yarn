Berau:Why am I here, you ask? I should be fleeing for safety? #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_8
Berau:Regrettably, that's not an option. I must face you in battle now! #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_9

Emma: Huh......? What...What...? #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_10
Emma:Fight? What are you talking about, you're friends with him, right? #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_11
Emma:Or are you just pranking us...? #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_12

Berau:I assume in my present form, you find that hard to believe. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_16

Bravo:Whoa! What the heck, this guy wasn't even a human!? #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_18

Hades:Now, do you believe me? #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_20
I'll reintroduce myself:I am Hades, a trusted aide to the Demon Lord. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_21
I'll reintroduce myself:Apologies for lying about me name. I preferred to keep my true identity concealed for obvious reasons. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_22
Emma:You are part of the inner circle of the Demon King... I can't believe it... #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_23

Hades:Rest assured, I'm not being manipulated or coerced. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_24
Hades:I hope you know that everything I've done has been of my own will. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_25
Emma:You've been lying to him the entire time! #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_26
Hades:Claiming I deceived (PlayerName) is a stretch. The only thing I wasn't truthful about was my name. Everything else, every word and emotion I shared with (PlayerName), was genuine. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_27
Emma:How can we trust words from someone who's hidden the truth? #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_28
Emma:I believed you were (PlayerName)'s friend, but in truth, we are actually enemies... #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_29
Hades:I don't see (PlayerName) as an enemy; I genuinely regard him as a close friend. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_30
Hades:Understand this, I wasn't being deceitful.I simply kept quiet. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_31
Hades:(PlayerName), you never mentioned your legendary heroic bloodline or that the Demon King has returned, posing a threat to the world, did you?That's likely because you didn't want to burden a friend like me with such challenging news and make me worry, right? #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_32
Hades:Just like you, I chose not to share certain things with my friend, (PlayerName), to avoid placing any undue burdens on him. We're the same,(PlayerName). #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_33
Bravo:Hey, you're a bad guy, I don't know what you're talking about. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_34
Hades:Initially, I just wanted to quell my curiosity. Rumors spread about a Hero destined to defeat the Demon King, and I figured I'd see what all the fuss was about. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_35
Hades:From the moment we first crossed paths in that fishing village, watching you in action left me awestruck. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_36
Hades:You exuded a brilliance unlike anything I had ever witnessed. We quickly bonded, learning more about each other.  #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_37
Hades:Every moment was genuine and joyful. I promise, I'm not lying. You've always been kind, just, strong, and noble. My fondness for you grew, and I truly cherished our friendship. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_38
Emma:Why, then, are you trying to fight? If he's such a good friend, why fight? You are crazy! #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_39

Hades:Because he's a cherished friend, I have to fight him. It's precisely for that reason... Oh well. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_40
Hades:I wished you could understand, but it's fine if you don't. Regardless, it won't change what I'm about to do. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_41
Hades:Face me first. Prove that you can stand up to the Demon King. #line:ch006_demon_castle_hades_42
