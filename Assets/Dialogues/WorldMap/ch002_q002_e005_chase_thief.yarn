    Emma: Well, we're going into the Lost Forest, so why don't we get a few things ready? #line:ch2chasethief10
    Emma: But without your wallet... Oh, you have a little bit of money that you've separated in another luggage. #line:ch2chasethief11
    Emma: Then let's get ready with that extra money and go after him. #line:ch2chasethief12
    Emma: I don't think that the thief will be able to get through the Lost Forest that easily, so I don't think we need to rush. #line:ch2chasethief13
