Emma: Is everything okay? Could it be that an enemy is nearby? #line:059728a

Emma: They're barking and being aggressive, but you're saying they're not the enemy?! Bravo, can you talk to them? Can you do something about this?! #line:05b5a6b 
Pack of Dogs: Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! #line:00d335e 
Bravo: I can't do it! I don't think you can talk to them, so I think we should just beat them up and force them to grow up!  #line:0e15459 
Pack of Dogs: Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! #line:08d13e6 
Emma: Argh! Your barking is getting too loud! If we don't do something, we'll go deaf! Let's get them to be quiet first! #line:06cd023
