Roman: “Thank you very much. As a favor, I'm asking you to retrieve a specific jewel from Elrod Castle. ”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_14
Roman: “It's an extremely important item, and transporting it in the usual way from the castle to the Great Church would pose significant security risks...”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_15
Roman: “It would be greatly beneficial if you could use your flying magic to swiftly bring it here.”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_16
Emma: “Why is it necessary to move such an important jewel from the castle to the church? Is there a problem?”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_17
Roman: “The jewel is needed for a tiara that will be given to Princess Olivia during her coming-of-age ceremony.”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_18

Emma: “What! Princess Olivia's?!”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_19
Roman: “Yes, indeed. This particular jewel was selected from among all the stones in the world to commemorate the princess's birth. ”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_20
Roman: “It has been carefully polished and has been kept at Elrod Castle for a long time. Two years before the princess's coming-of-age ceremony, the jewel is traditionally moved to our location in one go.”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_21
Roman: “The tiara, which will serve as its setting, is crafted from pure gold, purified right here at the Great Church.”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_22
Roman: “A blacksmith who is officially authorized to create sacred objects and ceremonial tools will forge this tiara from the pure gold. ”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_23
Roman: “We will then embed the jewel, which is entrusted to us by the castle, into this tiara, creating a magnificent piece of decorative art.”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_24
Roman: “This process completes the creation of the tiara that will be used for the princess's coming-of-age ceremony.”  #line:ch3_greatchurch3_2_25
