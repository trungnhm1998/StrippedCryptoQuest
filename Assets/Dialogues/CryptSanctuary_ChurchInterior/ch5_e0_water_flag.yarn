Roman: ...Hmm, you've managed to retrieve the legendary sword, but it appears the curse has marred it... #line:ch5_water_flag_1
Scholar: Well, well! This is quite interesting! #line:ch5_water_flag_2
Emma: That's why we were wondering if we could have an exorcism here at the Great Church? #line:ch5_water_flag_3
Roman: Despite the immense holy power of the Great Church, this curse seems too potent to simply dispel. #line:ch5_water_flag_4
Roman: This sword once belonged to the Legendary Hero and the very slayer of the Demon King. Only a truly unique power could stand against such a curse. #line:ch5_water_flag_5
Roman: So, perhaps matching legend with legend is the solution? #line:ch5_water_flag_6
Emma: Are you saying there's another way to do this? #line:ch5_water_flag_7
Roman: I've come across an ancient text within the Great Church that speaks of the 'Crystal Clear Water'. #line:ch5_water_flag_8
Emma: Crystal Clear Water? But isn't all water clear? #line:ch5_water_flag_9
Roman: The text reads, #line:ch5_water_flag_10
Roman:  'Drink from this serene water, and all impurities shall vanish.' It is the essence that purifies all.' #line:ch5_water_flag_10_1
Roman: It's said that this water once cured people of mysterious ailments and curses that plagued this continent. #line:ch5_water_flag_11
Roman:  It garnered its name for its unparalleled ability to purify and rejuvenate everything to 'crystal clear' clarity. #line:ch5_water_flag_11_1
Roman: By combining the power of this water with the sacred power of the Great Church in an exorcism ritual,  #line:ch5_water_flag_12
Roman: there's a possibility we could lift the curse. #line:ch5_water_flag_12_2
Emma: Okay we got it... Let's set out in search of this legendary water. #line:ch5_water_flag_13
Roman: Considering its description, it likely exists in a location resembling a lake.  #line:ch5_water_flag_14
Roman: And given its storied history of saving many, I'd think it's somewhere known to us, not a completely undiscovered location. #line:ch5_water_flag_14_1
Emma: Known locations... We should start by marking potential lakes on the map. #line:ch5_water_flag_15
Emma:  I believe our search will be quick. There can't be too many options. #line:ch5_water_flag_15_1

Bravo: How many locations do we need to explore? #line:ch5_water_flag_16

Emma: Umm... Looking at the map, we have a few options... First, there's a lake close to the Lost Forest. #line:ch5_water_flag_17
Emma:  Second, a lake situated on an island in the desert continent where the dead is worshipped.  #line:ch5_water_flag_17_1
Emma:  Third, although not a lake, there's a spring near the Elrod Castle. These are our best bets for now.  #line:ch5_water_flag_17_2
Emma:  If we investigate these sites, chances are we'll find the legendary water in one of them, right? #line:ch5_water_flag_17_3
Bravo: Alright! With master leading us, we'll find it in no time! #line:ch5_water_flag_18
