Roman: Ah, welcome back to the Great Church. What brings you here today? #line:ch5greatchurch1_1
Emma: Hi, Archbishop. We're here in search of some information. #line:ch5greatchurch1_2
Emma: The Knight Commander of Elrod Castle believes there's still untapped power within our friend here. We were hoping to find a way to unleash it. #line:ch5greatchurch1_3
Roman: Ah, young {GetPlayerName()}, the rumored descendant of the legendary hero, right? #line:ch5greatchurch1_4
Emma: Exactly, Archbishop. Maybe, you might know something that can help him awaken his latent strength? #line:ch5greatchurch1_5
Emma: Is there any chance that if we do something like pray here, maybe he'll awaken some new power? #line:ch5greatchurch1_6
Roman: I've not personally performed such an awakening, nor have I heard of such a thing here. #line:ch5greatchurch1_7
Roman: But given that young {GetPlayerName()}'s lineage is connected to the legendary heroes... #line:ch5greatchurch1_8
Roman: Maybe there is a connection..Ah! We do have a scholar well-versed in legendary heroes. #line:ch5greatchurch1_8_1
Roman: Maybe he can shed some light on the matter. I shall call him for you. #line:ch5greatchurch1_8_2
Emma: Really? We weren't expecting that such a great teacher exist! #line:ch5greatchurch1_9

Scholar: Ah! Greetings, young ones! So, this is the legendary hero's descendant? Fascinating! And with a fairy and werewolf by his side?  #line:ch5greatchurch1_10
Scholar: This composition... It's reminiscent of the old tales! This orthodox feeling stirs the passion in my scholar's heart! #line:ch5greatchurch1_10_1
Scholar: Ah! Ah! Ah! Let me see, let me see! #line:ch5greatchurch1_10_2
Emma: Your welcome, I guess... #line:ch5greatchurch1_11

Emma: Does the teacher have knowledge about unlocking {GetPlayerName()}'s dormant power? #line:ch5greatchurch1_12
Scholar: I'm hesitant to be labeled an instructor! I'm just super into hero lore, and somehow people started calling me a teacher because of it.  #line:ch5greatchurch1_13
Scholar: And truthfully, I've grown fond of the title! #line:ch5greatchurch1_13_1
Scholar:To unveil the latent power of the Legendary Hero's descendants... #line:ch5greatchurch1_14
Scholar:Let me think... Yes! #line:ch5greatchurch1_14_1
Scholar:While I might just be a hero enthusiast, it's clear that Mr. {GetPlayerName()} lacks certain things a true Legendary Hero would need to defeat the Demon King. #line:ch5greatchurch1_14_2
Emma: Certain things that are important? #line:ch5greatchurch1_15
Scholar: It's a sword! Every legendary hero has their iconic sword! #line:ch5greatchurch1_16
Scholar: Your current weapon is pretty impressive, but to stand a chance against the Demon King, you'll likely need a legendary sword! #line:ch5greatchurch1_17
Roman: I see your point. #line:ch5greatchurch1_18
Roman: This legendary sword... you mean the one that defeated the Demon King? #line:ch5greatchurch1_19
Scholar: Indeed! There are numerous tales,  #line:ch5greatchurch1_20
Scholar:but it's commonly believed that the sword capable of defeating the Demon King was bestowed upon the legendary hero by the Goddess herself. #line:ch5greatchurch1_20_1
Scholar:It's said that this particular sword, graced by the Goddess's might, is the only weapon capable of piercing the Demon King's heart.  #line:ch5greatchurch1_20_2
Scholar:Should Mr. {GetPlayerName()} come into possession of it, his powers would likely see a significant increase. #line:ch5greatchurch1_20_3
Emma: A sword that can defeat the Demon King, infused with the Goddess's power... It's like something out of a legend! #line:ch5greatchurch1_21
Emma: So where is such an important artifact kept? Within a castle? #line:ch5greatchurch1_22
Scholar: Regrettably, detailed accounts of the events following the Demon King's downfall are scarce.  #line:ch5greatchurch1_23
Scholar: As such, the current resting place of the sword post-sealing the Demon King remains a mystery even to me. #line:ch5greatchurch1_23_1
Emma: Wait, a sword that significant is missing? #line:ch5greatchurch1_24
Scholar: Once the tale reached its crescendo with the Demon King's defeat, many narrators tend to hasten towards its conclusion.  #line:ch5greatchurch1_25
Scholar: The writings that do exist often hint cryptically, suggesting the sword is safely tucked away, though specifics are elusive. #line:ch5greatchurch1_25_1
Emma: So, you're saying the information we have is pretty limited and kind of unclear? #line:ch5greatchurch1_26
Scholar: I'm genuinely curious. Given Mr. {GetPlayerName()}'s lineage as the descendant of a legendary hero, shouldn't he be privy to such knowledge?  #line:ch5greatchurch1_27
Scholar: Historically, these tales and artifacts are passed down, generation after generation. Perhaps elegantly inscribed on ancient scrolls?  #line:ch5greatchurch1_27_1
Scholar:Or maybe, just maybe, hidden away in a chamber,awaiting the right key to unlock a treasure trove â€“ like a legendary sword? #line:ch5greatchurch1_27_2
Emma: No...I don't think we have anything like that in our house... #line:ch5greatchurch1_28
Emma: His father, Noah, kept quiet about his family's heroic past, even with their impressive history.  #line:ch5greatchurch1_29
Emma: But he did, however, teach us about swordsmanship, magic, wilderness survival, and stuff like that... #line:ch5greatchurch1_29_1

Emma:The only family I have left is his father, Noah, but his whereabouts remains unknown.  #line:ch5greatchurch1_30
Emma:Would retracing our steps back to our residence be important? There might be overlooked clues that we could find. #line:ch5greatchurch1_30_1

Emma: You've looked through the books shelved within our home, but you couldn't find anything?  #line:ch5greatchurch1_31
Emma: If that's the case, rummaging through our house might be a waste of time... This is quite a puzzle. #line:ch5greatchurch1_31_1

Emma: Wait, what? The soldier we helped back in Cardano talked about seeing ghosts.  #line:ch5greatchurch1_32
Emma: And one of your friends mentioned this odd tale about a lake that lights up at night. Are you suggesting these stories sound alike? #line:ch5greatchurch1_32_1

Emma: Going to that location could potentially allow us to encounter these spirits, and it's possible that among them might be your ancestors.  #line:ch5greatchurch1_33
Emma: However, even if such special beings are present there, arranging a direct meeting with your specific ancestors could prove to be difficult. #line:ch5greatchurch1_33_1
Roman: Rumors of shimmering ponds and lakes under moonlight are tales I've often encountered. #line:ch5greatchurch1_34
Roman: Most stories of such phenomena are either the result of misinterpretations, overzealous embellishments, or quirks of nature.  #line:ch5greatchurch1_35
Roman: Nevertheless, given young {GetPlayerName()}'s intrigue, perhaps this path bears some purpose.  #line:ch5greatchurch1_35_1
Roman: Might I suggest trusting your inner instincts and go there at least once? #line:ch5greatchurch1_35_2
Roman: Should this place indeed serve as a location for departed souls, it could imply that our forbearers,feeling their tales yet untold,  #line:ch5greatchurch1_36
Roman: linger closer to our realm than we previously believed. #line:ch5greatchurch1_36_1

Emma: Yes you are right, Archbishop. We will go give it a try at least. #line:ch5greatchurch1_37
Roman: May you tread with caution. I earnestly hope and pray for your success in acquiring the legendary sword. #line:ch5greatchurch1_38
Scholar: Mr. {GetPlayerName()}, might I request a reenactment of the iconic stance from 'The Legend of the Brave:Love, Courage, Adventure,  #line:ch5greatchurch1_39
Scholar:  the Evil Demon King, and Volume Three'?  #line:ch5greatchurch1_39_1
Scholar:The illustration depicts a gallant champion, triumphantly lifting the legendary sword towards the heavens, a symbol of joy and accomplishment! #line:ch5greatchurch1_39_2
Scholar: While this book has a compelling storyline, its interpretation diverges significantly from established lore. Scholars remain divided #line:ch5greatchurch1_40
Scholar: ; some complain it as a fanciful departure from true legends, while others hail it as an accessible and well-crafted retelling for everyone.  #line:ch5greatchurch1_40_1
Scholar: Personally, I embrace such creativity! #line:ch5greatchurch1_40_2
Scholar:  I proudly proclaim my status as a genuine expert of hero lore, delighting in various interpretations!  #line:ch5greatchurch1_40_3
Scholar: And this particular pose from the illustration? Oh, it captivates me even more... #line:ch5greatchurch1_40_4
Roman: It appears this conversation might linger for a while. I suggest young {GetPlayerName()}, to proceed on your journey. #line:ch5greatchurch1_41
Roman: I shall keep the conversation going and provide remarks as needed. #line:ch5greatchurch1_41_1
Emma: Ye.. Yes. Thank you Archbishop and Mr. Teacher. #line:ch5greatchurch1_42

Emma: We should head to that lake near the desert continent you mentioned. Hopefully, we'll run into the spirits of your ancestors there. #line:ch5greatchurch1_43
