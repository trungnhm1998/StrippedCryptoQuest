Believer A: Ladies and gentlemen...I see that you have returned from the Archbishop's request.  #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_8
Believer A:I was just wondering if I had to call you back, so I'm glad that you came.  #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_9


Emma: Hey, what's all this fuss? We are hearing something about the Archbishop falling ill.  #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_10

Believer A: I'm sorry, but this is not the place to discuss such matters, so please follow me.  #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_11

Believer A: To make a long story short, while you were all at the castle of Elrod, the Archbishop fell suddenly ill. He was treated immediately and is now conscious, but... his condition is not looking good.  #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_12

Emma: What! Is he okay?!  #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_13

Believer A: .....  #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_14

Emma: That doesn't sound reassuring...  #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_15

Believer A: The archbishop had just told me that if he could not recover after all this treatment, he would need the help of all those who have the blood of the Braves in their veins.  #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_16

Emma: You want our help to heal the sick? ...But I think the church is much better at curing illnesses than I am...I can only heal minor injuries....   #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_17
Emma: Oh, maybe you want us to go get special medicinal herbs that only grow in dangerous places? That kind of thing seems likely, since that's what we are good at, right?  #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_18

Believer A: I haven't been told that much detail either...so...come on, we're getting there now. The Archbishop will tell you the rest.  #line:ch3_GreatChurch_DownRoman_19
