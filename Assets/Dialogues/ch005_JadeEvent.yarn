A Woman's Voice:Why are you all trotting around so leisurely? It seems like you're not even trying. #line:JadeEvent_1
A Woman's Voice:Shouldn't I be able to conquer a castle like this quickly? Don't you all want some lovely rewards? #line:JadeEvent_2
Demon Army:Grr....!! #line:JadeEvent_3
Demon Army:Rooooar--!! #line:JadeEvent_4

Woman:Come on, come on, push harder, this effort is far from sufficient. #line:JadeEvent_11
Woman:Tear down these walls swiftly. Your haste only serves to irritate me. #line:JadeEvent_12

Leonhardt:Ugh...! #line:JadeEvent_16
Woman:Well, I'm surprised you withstood that; you might not have any skills, but you're more resilient than I thought. #line:JadeEvent_17
Leonhardt:Ugh...Why... you... *cough**cough*! #line:JadeEvent_18

Emma:Lady Leonhardt! Take it easy! #line:JadeEvent_19
Bravo:Leo something something, are you okay!? Who is that fish woman! #line:JadeEvent_20
<<waite 1.0>>
Woman:What's the matter? Your eyes. From your expression, did I step out of line? #line:JadeEvent_21
Woman:Isn't it expected for someone to discipline a misbehaving pet? #line:JadeEvent_22
Emma:You claim she had it coming? You are the one who did such a terrible thing to Lady Leonhardt...! #line:JadeEvent_23
Woman:I just simply reprimanded her for her boring approach towards me. #line:JadeEvent_24
Woman:Why do all these pets appear so frail and senseless? #line:JadeEvent_25
Emma:Wh..at!! #line:JadeEvent_26

Leonhardt:...Be cautious... her power is off the charts... The General Ogre pales in comparison to her strength... #line:JadeEvent_27
Woman:So, you're the ones who bested the General Ogre? He was a valuable pet... although, you display remarkable skill for a human. Quite Impressive. #line:JadeEvent_28
Woman:Ah yes! Rather than having the General Ogre as my pet, I could just have you as my cute pets. Sounds like a fitting arrangement, doesn't it? #line:JadeEvent_29
Woman:Hehe, Serve me with your loyalty, and I shall bestow upon you wonderful gifts. #line:JadeEvent_30
Bravo:No way! My master is my master and only my master! #line:JadeEvent_31
Emma:Why the barrage of weird and disrespectful remarks? Arghh...Who do you think you are!? #line:JadeEvent_32
Woman:It pleases me when someone listens intently to their master's name, especially those who value loyalty and honesty. Very well, my healthy pets, #line:JadeEvent_33
Woman:I am one of the Four Heavenly Kings, a direct subordinate of the Demon Lord. I am known as the Water Jade. #line:JadeEvent_34

Emma:Four Heavenly Kings!? #line:JadeEvent_35
Bravo:What is that!? #line:JadeEvent_36
<<waite 1.5>>
Jade:You've remembered the master's name correctly, haven't you? #line:JadeEvent_37
Jade:Now, approach and kneel, beg for Master Jade to make you her pet. #line:JadeEvent_38

Jade:How could this be happening to me?! I never imagined I'd be defeated! #line:JadeEvent_39
Jade:No...no...no...! Oh....ohhhhhhh...... #line:JadeEvent_40
Emma:New... Master ......? #line:JadeEvent_41
Jade:Ah...! Command Jade as you wish, Master...! #line:JadeEvent_42
Emma:What? Huh? Huh? What? What's goin on? #line:JadeEvent_43
Bravo:Ah, she's clearly recognized my master's strength! Yes, yes! #line:JadeEvent_44
Bravo:But she seems a bit weird, so I'd advise against getting too close to her, Master! #line:JadeEvent_45
Emma:You stay back a little bit! I'll deal with her! #line:JadeEvent_46

Emma:An orb..? What is this? #line:JadeEvent_48
Jade:This is the [Sealed Treasure Orb]. The one in my possession is blue, but there are three others:red, green, and yellow... #line:JadeEvent_49
Emma:Oh, I see. What's in it for us when you collect them all? #line:JadeEvent_50
Jade:It activates a warp gate leading to the island where the Demon Lord lives. #line:JadeEvent_51

Emma:Now we can go to the Demon King's castle...! #line:JadeEvent_52
Emma:Jade, where are the other treasures! If you have them, get them all out!!!! #line:JadeEvent_53
Jade:Ah....! The other treasure orbs are held by the remaining Four Heavenly Kings! #line:JadeEvent_54
Jade:They are Coral of the Earth, the twins Lapis and Jasper of the Wind, and Topaz of Fire! #line:JadeEvent_55
Jade:Coral has ventured to a port town, the twins to a prison city, and Topaz to a desert village! #line:JadeEvent_56
Emma:So we'll have to fight the other three Four Heavenly Kings... So what do we do with all the jewels once we have them all? #line:JadeEvent_57
Jade:Once you've gathered all the orbs, proceed deeper into the area past where you confronted the General Ogre. #line:JadeEvent_58
Jade:There, you'll find a shrine. Place the treasure orbs in it, and the gateway to the Demon Lord's Castle will open. #line:JadeEvent_59
Emma:It's a shrine in the forest at the back of the fierce battleground.Now, tell me more. What do you know about the Demon Lord's vulnerabilities, the layout of his castle, and anything else relevant? #line:JadeEvent_60
Jade:Ah... I can't endure any more of this torment. Please, I beg for mercy. #line:JadeEvent_61
Jade:It was an honor for Jade to encounter someone as formidable as you, Master. #line:JadeEvent_62

Emma:Oh, she's gone... She told us a lot of things and was very helpful, but I wonder what that sudden change in attitude was all about... #line:JadeEvent_63
Bravo:That was a weird one... #line:JadeEvent_64
Leonhardt:Well, at the very least, we've gathered some intel. It looks like our next task is collecting those orbs. #line:JadeEvent_65
Bravo:Leo, you're up! Good to see you're okay. You could learn a thing or two from my master! #line:JadeEvent_66
Emma:Bravo, be careful with your words! Leonhardt is wounded! #line:JadeEvent_67
Leonhardt:You are correct Bravo. My emotions got the best of me in the heat of the moment. #line:JadeEvent_68
Leonhardt:As a protector of this country, I clearly need to train further. #line:JadeEvent_69

Leonhardt:We need to act fast. The longer we take to collect the remaining orbs, the more the city remains at risk. #line:JadeEvent_70
Leonhardt:I'll ensure that the castle remains safe from any further attacks. #line:JadeEvent_71
Leonhardt:Piecing together Jade's information, it seems the other four kings are dispersed across distinct regions. #line:JadeEvent_72
Leonhardt:Coral of the Earth is said to be in the port town of Ether, #line:JadeEvent_73
Leonhardt:Wind twins Lapis and Jasper are in the prison city of Tether, #line:JadeEvent_74
Leonhardt:And Topaz of Fire resides in the desert village of Cardano. #line:JadeEvent_75
Leonhardt:After gathering the orbs, we need to bring them to the shrine situated deeper than where the General Ogre confrontation occurred, in the battleground forest. #line:JadeEvent_76
Emma:Alright! Let's defeat the remaining Four Heavenly Kings and get into the Demon King's Castle! #line:JadeEvent_77
Bravo:With my master and me, it's easy! It won't be long before we get to the Demon King, master! #line:JadeEvent_78
Leonhardt:You'll be facing the Four Heavenly Kings; make sure you're well-prepared. #line:JadeEvent_79
