Errand Boy: Huff puff… I'm so glad I got here in time... Um... The King sent me... Um... There's something I wanted to tell you all… *Huff puff*… *Huff puff*…  #line:ch3_ship_complete_7
Emma: From the King? What is going on?  #line:ch3_ship_complete_8
Errand Boy: Phew...... Excuse me.Now, I have a message from the King.   #line:ch3_ship_complete_9
Errand Boy: Once you get a boat, he says to continue on to an island called Crypto Sanctuary, where the headquarters of the CryptoRec Church is located.  #line:ch3_ship_complete_10
Emma: The island where the church headquarters is located...?  #line:ch3_ship_complete_11
Errand Boy: Yes, from this port town of Ether, there is a small island to the southeast,   #line:ch3_ship_complete_12
Errand Boy: where the Crypto Sanctuary is located. It's in an easy-to-find location, so you won't get lost.  #line:ch3_ship_complete_13
Bravo: Why do we have to stop at that something-something place?Now that I finally have access to a boat, I want to go where I want to go!  #line:ch3_ship_complete_14

Errand Boy: Please don't say that....The church headquarters built in the Crypto Sanctuary,  #line:ch3_ship_complete_15
Errand Boy: also known as the CryptoRec Great Church, is home to Archbishop Roman,   #line:ch3_ship_complete_16
Errand Boy: and there is also the World Library, a collection of all the world's books, which handles forbidden books.  #line:ch3_ship_complete_17
Emma: I see, that's important. We have to go to that island, Bravo.  #line:ch3_ship_complete_18
Bravo: Is that so? Well, I guess I don't have a choice then! I don't know what it means, but I get it!  #line:ch3_ship_complete_19

Errand Boy: It's a truly enviable opportunity, one that you simply must pursue... But are you fully aware of the entire context?   #line:ch3_ship_complete_20
Errand You see, the Crypto Sanctuary is a sacred island, accessible only to a select few.   #line:ch3_ship_complete_21
Errand The CryptoRec Great Church is not just the central hub of the CryptoRec kingdom but also an architecturally magnificent structure. It's a grand, white, and stunning building...   #line:ch3_ship_complete_22
Errand Boy: I've always dreamed of entering it just once in my lifetime, though I'm certain such a chance is unlikely for me…  #line:ch3_ship_complete_23
Emma: Wow, it sounds like an awesome place!   #line:ch3_ship_complete_24
Errand Boy: Yes, precisely. So if we happen to cross paths again, please share with me what it was like!  #line:ch3_ship_complete_25
