Emma:....The believers who discovered us said they heard a loud commotion near the entrance of the Crypto Sanctuary. #line:ch006_great_church_3
Emma:When they investigated, they found us collapsed, injured, and unresponsive. They quickly brought us to the Great Church for care and protection... #line:ch006_great_church_4

Emma:I...I hid myself in your clothing as quickly as I could. #line:ch006_great_church_5
Emma:That's likely why I wasn't as injured as the others, and I have vague memories from that period. I'm fairly certain it was Berau... or rather... Hades, was the one who carried us to this island. #line:ch006_great_church_6

Emma:Though he's part of the inner circle of the Demon King, he called you as a friend and appeared to want to help us, even while he fought us. And in the end, he directed us to the Cursed Mansion to retrieve something, didn't he? #line:ch006_great_church_7
Emma:I'm trying to understand Hades' true intentions. Is he mocking and playing games with us? #line:ch006_great_church_8
===

Emma:...So throughout all this, you never sensed any ill intentions from him? You believe he was genuine and truthful with you the entire time? #line:ch006_great_church_9

Emma:That just adds to the confusion... It would make more sense to me if he was just deceiving his enemies. #line:ch006_great_church_10

Doctor:...I apologize for interrupting your thoughts, but may I first examine Mister (PlayerName) to check for any abnormalities? #line:ch006_great_church_11

Emma:...(PlayerName), we'll talk about Hades later. #line:ch006_great_church_13

Doctor:Everything seems in order now, I found no issues. #line:ch006_great_church_14
Doctor: (PlayerName) sustained the most injuries, yet your recovery is remarkable. Truly befitting of a hero. #line:ch006_great_church_15
Emma:Oh, I'm glad you've healed properly. #line:ch006_great_church_16
Emma:Even in that last assault, you moved to shield the others... #line:ch006_great_church_17
Doctor:The rest of the group has already awakened. He is recuperating in a separate room, he will need a bit more time for a full recovery. #line:ch006_great_church_18
Doctor:Thus, I recommend visiting the Archbishop. He expressed a desire to speak with you ,(PlayerName), once you were awake. #line:ch006_great_church_19
Emma:Okay, we will. #line:ch006_great_church_20

Roman:I'm relieved to hear that. #line:ch006_great_church_26
Roman:But arriving at the Crypto Sanctuary in such a battered state... What transpired? #line:ch006_great_church_27
===

Emma:You see, as we ventured through the Demon King's castle, we encountered someone namedHades. He's part of the inner circle of the Demon King. #line:ch006_great_church_28
Emma:He was incredibly formidable, and we eventually had to retreat... #line:ch006_great_church_29
Roman:I see, so that's the ordeal you faced. #line:ch006_great_church_30
Roman:Having an adversary of such strength just before confronting the Demon King is concerning. #line:ch006_great_church_31
Emma:Archbishop, do know anything about Hades? #line:ch006_great_church_32
Roman:Hades... Hmmm... That name doesn't ring any bells for me.... #line:ch006_great_church_33
Roman:It's not mentioned in the sacred texts of the Great Church. Could he be a demon conjured by the Demon Lord himself? #line:ch006_great_church_34
Emma:It seems even you, the Archbishop, aren't familiar with him? #line:ch006_great_church_35
Roman:I apologize for my lack of knowledge on the matter... #line:ch006_great_church_36
Emma:No, please don't apologize. #line:ch006_great_church_37
Emma:Well, I've heard that it might be a great idea to visit the Cursed Mansion as it might hold some tools of significance. #line:ch006_great_church_38
Emma:Are you familiar with it, Archbishop? I'm hesitant because the source of this information isn't entirely trustworthy... #line:ch006_great_church_39
Roman:Ah, yes, I'm familiar with the Cursed Mansion. I can provide you with the details you seek. In fact, there's a specific tool from the mansion that could be of utmost importance. #line:ch006_great_church_40
Emma:What, oh, that information was real...? #line:ch006_great_church_41
Roman:Indeed, the Cursed Mansion can be found to the most northeastern part on the map, nestled deep within the forest. Legend has it that the mansion was once home to a powerful Witch. Originally a skilled mage, she became obsessed with the quest for immortality.  #line:ch006_great_church_42
Roman:Through countless experiments on human beings, her mind and body deteriorated, driving her to madness and transforming her into a monstrous being. #line:ch006_great_church_43
Roman:The church has dispatched many to confront her on multiple occasions. However, every time, we were repelled, finding ourselves unable to defeat her... #line:ch006_great_church_44
===

Roman: Next, I'll shall share about the item at the Cursed Mansion. Historical accounts suggest that a revered saint once ventured into the Cursed Mansion, seeking to kill the malevolent Witch. #line:ch006_great_church_45
Emma:A Saint that goes to kill a Witch... #line:ch006_great_church_46
Emma:This Saint was known for his profound compassion, unable to harm even the smallest insect. He was the sort of individual who would tirelessly approach even the gravest sinner, offering redemption. #line:ch006_great_church_47
Emma:Yet tragedy struck when the Witch abducted the Saint's only daughter, subjecting her to dark experiments. #line:ch006_great_church_48
Emma:The outcome was horrible; the once vibrant young woman was reduced to an unrecognizable, grotesque mass. It was only the presence of her cherished bracelet that helped identify her... #line:ch006_great_church_49
Emma:.... #line:ch006_great_church_50
Roman:Upon witnessing the horrifying transformation of his daughter, the Saint was consumed by a mix of profound sorrow, rage, and desperation. To confront the Witch, he harnessed pure light, crafting the 'Ring of Destruction' from it. Legends say that during its creation, the world was plunged into darkness for seven days as all light was absorbed. #line:ch006_great_church_51
Roman:However, the power of the 'Ring of Destruction' was beyond even the Saint's expectations. When he tried to wield it against the Witch, its light energy burned him, resulting in his tragic death before he could even kill her. #line:ch006_great_church_52
Roman:As the tales go, even the evil Witch couldn't handle or destroy the 'Ring of Destruction'. Thus, it remains untouched within the confines of the Cursed Mansion. #line:ch006_great_church_53
Roman:That very artifact is the one you must seek within the Cursed Mansion. #line:ch006_great_church_54

Emma:It's tragic how he was burned to death. His overwhelming desire to avenge his daughter pushed him to create something beyond his own control. It's quite sad... #line:ch006_great_church_55
Roman:Perhaps the tale was preserved to teach us not to succumb to anger. The Saint may have faltered, but perhaps Mr. (PlayerName), with his heroic spirit, can harness and command the immense energy of that 'Ring of Destruction'. #line:ch006_great_church_56
Roman:With the 'Ring of Destruction', based on the information gathered by Mr. (PlayerName) and the group, we could amplify our strength against the great demons. It might even provide the edge we need to defeat Hades or whatever he truly is. #line:ch006_great_church_57
Emma:...Against the great evil.... #line:ch006_great_church_58
Emma:Then when everyone recovers, let's get ready and head to the Cursed Mansion to get the 'Ring of Destruction'. #line:ch006_great_church_59
===

Roman:You are drawing nearer to the Demon King's lair. Remember not to overexert yourself. If ever you sense danger, don't hesitate to return to the church for healing. #line:ch006_great_church_60

Emma:.......What Hades told us wasn't a lie.... #line:ch006_great_church_61
Emma:Acquiring the 'Ring of Destruction' from the Cursed Mansion would empower us, wouldn't it? Why would Hades want us to strengthen ourselves? #line:ch006_great_church_62

Emma:It bothers me to follow Hades' advice, but it seems we have little choice in the matter now. #line:ch006_great_church_63

Emma:(PlayerName), do you realize? #line:ch006_great_church_64
Emma:If we get the 'Ring of the Destruction' in the Cursed Mansion, we'll then have to go back to the Demon King's Castle... #line:ch006_great_church_65
Emma:Will you be okay? If you had to fight Hades again, who is your friend, would you be able to fight to the very end? #line:ch006_great_church_66
===

YES #line:ch006_great_church_67
Emma:...Right. You're hoping to confront him as a friend and bring him back to his senses. #line:ch006_great_church_68
Emma:However, if both of you don't understand each other, be ready to face him to the end as enemies and finish the fight. #line:ch006_great_church_69

NO #line:ch006_great_church_71
Emma:...It's tough, considering how long we believed we were friends. I truly don't want to fight him either. Yet, we both know that to defeat the Demon King, we'll have to... #line:ch006_great_church_72

Emma:Our plan is to acquire the 'Ring of Destruction', a tool with the power to combat great demons, and then return to the Demon King's castle to confront Hades. #line:ch006_great_church_91
Bravo:Hmm, I see! Then let's go get that tool and go to the Demon King's castle as soon as possible! #line:ch006_great_church_92
Bravo:That strange, nasty guy is a friend of my master, right? In that case, I believe you should give him a good beating and set him straight soon! #line:ch006_great_church_93
