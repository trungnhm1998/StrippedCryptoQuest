Patrick:Ah, the legendary blacksmith. #line:LegendBlacksmith_40
Volunteer Army A:I don't know, man. #line:LegendBlacksmith_41
Volunteer Army B:...Now that you mention it...maybe I've met that guy before... #line:LegendBlacksmith_42
Emma:What!? Really !? #line:LegendBlacksmith_43
Volunteer Army B:After a job vanquishing demons, a seemingly intoxicated and mysterious elder approached me. #line:LegendBlacksmith_44
Volunteer Army B:Noticing the sword at my side, he commented on its condition and, feeling generous, offered to sharpen it for me... #line:LegendBlacksmith_45
Volunteer Army B:After handing it back to me, I was amazed. The blade had transformed, gleaming with sharpness. It was so razor-edged that with a gentle swing, I could have effortlessly sliced through a golem's neck. #line:LegendBlacksmith_46
Emma:Wow...just like the rumors! #line:LegendBlacksmith_47

Patrick:So what about that sword? Do you still have it? #line:LegendBlacksmith_48
Volunteer Army B:The other day, I nearly sliced my leg off when I accidentally dropped that sword. It terrified me so much that I stashed it deep in the storage. #line:LegendBlacksmith_49
Volunteer Army B:I'm too petrified to even wield it now. I wish it would just dull and rust over time. #line:LegendBlacksmith_50
Volunteer Army A:A potent weapon is meaningless if one cannot wield it proficiently... #line:LegendBlacksmith_51
Emma:I'm convinced that man is the legendary blacksmith! Tell me mister, where did you come across him? #line:LegendBlacksmith_52
Volunteer Army B:If I recall correctly, it was at {GetPlayerName()}. Oh, and that peculiar old man had a headband on. You might recognize him by that. #line:LegendBlacksmith_53
Patrick:I'll mark down the location of that region, and my dear can search for a landmarked figure in that vicinity. #line:LegendBlacksmith_54
Emma:Thank you for sharing that information with us! #line:LegendBlacksmith_55
Emma:Let's set out to locate the legendary blacksmith with the clues we have! #line:LegendBlacksmith_56
