Patrick: Ah, the legendary blacksmith. #line:LegendBlacksmith_40
Volunteer Army A: I don't know, man. #line:LegendBlacksmith_41
Volunteer Army B: ... Now that you mention it... Maybe I've met that guy before..." #line:LegendBlacksmith_42
Emma:What?! Really?! #line:LegendBlacksmith_43
Volunteer Army B: Not long ago, I was coming back from a monster-slaying job, and this drunken, shady old man approached me. #line:LegendBlacksmith_44
Volunteer Army B: He saw the sword at my waist and said it was poorly maintained. Said he was in a good mood that day and would sharpen it for me. #line:LegendBlacksmith_45
Volunteer Army B: Before I could even answer, he snatched my sword, took out his tools, and started sharpening it on his own... #line:LegendBlacksmith_45_2
Volunteer Army B: When he handed it back, saying it was done, #line:LegendBlacksmith_46
Volunteer Army B: The sword was shining brightly and had become something else entirely with an exceptional edge. #line:LegendBlacksmith_46_2
Volunteer Army B: It seemed like I could easily decapitate a golem with just a simple swing. #line:LegendBlacksmith_46_3
Emma: Wow... It's just like the rumors! #line:LegendBlacksmith_47

Patrick: So what about that sword? Do you still have it? #line:LegendBlacksmith_48
Volunteer Army B: The other day, I accidentally dropped the sword and nearly severed my own foot.  #line:LegendBlacksmith_49
Volunteer Army B: It scared me so much that I ended up hiding it deep in the storeroom. #line:LegendBlacksmith_49_2
Volunteer Army B: It's so terrifying that it's practically useless now. I'm actually hoping it rusts and becomes dull soon. #line:LegendBlacksmith_50
Volunteer Army A: No matter how great a weapon is, it's meaningless if you can't handle it properly... #line:LegendBlacksmith_51
Emma: I'm convinced that man is the legendary blacksmith! Tell me mister, where did you come across him? #line:LegendBlacksmith_52
Volunteer Army B: Let's see... it was southeast of the town, near the church. And that suspicious old man was dressed in all black, so you might want to use that as a marker. #line:LegendBlacksmith_53
Emma: Got it, thanks for the information! #line:LegendBlacksmith_55
Emma: Alright, let's head out and try to find this legendary blacksmith based on what we've been told! #line:LegendBlacksmith_56
