Olivia: Well, that's good to hear. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_31
Olivia: Should you feel tired, we've arranged a room for you to rest. Just let any of our castle staff know. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_32
Emma: Thank you very much. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_33
Emma: We're still full of energy, but how are you doing, Princess Olivia? #line:ch6oliviarescue1_34
Emma: Being a prisoner of the Demon King must have been tough on you. It sounds like a time full of stress and worry... #line:ch6oliviarescue1_35
Olivia: I was confined for quite a while, but I believe what you all endured during your journey was far more challenging. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_36
Olivia: Please, don't worry over me. Just being back in the castle, surrounded by support, brings immense relief. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_37
Emma: Everyone was worried about the princess, so I'm really glad to see you safe and sound like this. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_38

Emma: Princess Olivia! Are you okay!? #line:ch6oliviarescue1_51
Olivia: I... I apologize. I felt a sudden wave of dizziness... #line:ch6oliviarescue1_52
Emma: You've just returned to the castle after such an ordeal. Maybe the festivities and the drink took a toll on you. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_53
Emma: The King and Queen are nearby; maybe it's best if you take a moment to rest. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_53_2
Olivia: I suppose the joy of finally being at a lively party after such a long time got the better of me. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_54
Olivia: It's a bit embarrassing in front of all of you. I'll take the fairy's advice and return to my parents' side for some rest. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_54_2
Emma: Yes, be careful where you step as you go. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_55
Olivia: Thank you. Now if you'll excuse me. Please continue to enjoy yourselves. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_56
Olivia: ... It's going to be lively for a while now that we've defeated the Demon King,  #line:ch6oliviarescue1_57
Olivia: but when things settle down, I'd like to thank you again for your kindness. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_57_2
