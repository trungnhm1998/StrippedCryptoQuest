Emma:Would you like some time to yourself? #line:ch005_belau_again2_9
Emma:But... No.... Understood. We all need moments of solitude now and then. #line:ch005_belau_again2_10
Emma:We'll wait for you at the inn in the castle town. Please join us before it gets too late. Bravo, let's head to the inn. #line:ch005_belau_again2_11

Berau:I'm surprised to bump into you in such a bustling city! I've been selling the items from my travels at the local tool shop here. What brings you,(PlayerName), to this place? #line:ch005_belau_again2_15
Berau:.... #line:ch005_belau_again2_16

Berau:..... , What's wrong? #line:ch005_belau_again2_17
Berau:Your face is pale and you look a bit more weary and drained than I remember. Everything alright? #line:ch005_belau_again2_18

Berau:.... #line:ch005_belau_again2_19
Berau:I'm tired from all the walking in the city. Hey (PlayerName), how about we take a short break together? #line:ch005_belau_again2_20

Berau:I sold a lot of my items earlier, so I don't have a huge selection right now... #line:ch005_belau_again2_22
Berau:How about trying this fruit? #line:ch005_belau_again2_23

Berau:Come on, give it a taste! #line:ch005_belau_again2_24

Berau:Caught off guard? It packs quite a sour punch, right? #line:ch005_belau_again2_25
Berau:...I apologize for the sudden surprise, but despite its sourness, this fruit is delicious, packed with nutrients, and great for rejuvenation. #line:ch005_belau_again2_26
Berau:..Whenever I feel drained or overwhelmed by my journey, I snack on this. It always make me feel a bit better. #line:ch005_belau_again2_27
Berau:It doesn't make a huge difference..... but I thought it might lift your spirits, even if just a tad. #line:ch005_belau_again2_28

Berau:So, how about it? Do you feel better? #line:ch005_belau_again2_29
-> YES #line:ch005_belau_again2_30
	Berau:Phew, That's a relief. #line:ch005_belau_again2_31
	Berau:It's heartening to see that even a small snack can make a difference. #line:ch005_belau_again2_32
-> NO #line:ch005_belau_again2_33
	Berau:Oh, that's unfortunate. #line:ch005_belau_again2_34

Berau:.... #line:ch005_belau_again2_38
Berau:I'm at a loss for words right now. #line:ch005_belau_again2_39
Berau:Growing up without a family, I've always been on my own. So, I might not fully grasp the depth of pain you're feeling from losing someone dear to you. #line:ch005_belau_again2_40
Berau:I can't completely relate to everything you're experiencing or offer the exact comfort you might need... #line:ch005_belau_again2_41
Berau:Your journey is so selfless, helping others, while I've mostly been journeying for my own reasons. #line:ch005_belau_again2_42
Berau:Ever since we met, I've seen you as strong, kind, and admirable. You possess qualities I've always wished for... #line:ch005_belau_again2_43
Berau:I genuinely hope that with time, (PlayerName), your pain eases. #line:ch005_belau_again2_44

Berau:Wait, you're a descendant of the legendary hero? And you're on a quest to defeat the Demon King? #line:ch005_belau_again2_48
<<wait 2>>
Berau:Wow... #line:ch005_belau_again2_49
Berau:Ah....No need to apologize for keeping it a secret.. #line:ch005_belau_again2_50
Berau:Everyone has their reasons for the things they do. #line:ch005_belau_again2_51

Berau:You being a descendant or not doesn't change my view of you. You're still the same person I respect and support, because of your strength and kindness. #line:ch005_belau_again2_54
Berau:Stay safe. I believe in your ability to defeat the Demon King. #line:ch005_belau_again2_55
Berau:It seems you might have others waiting for you too. I should be on my way. #line:ch005_belau_again2_56

Emma:Welcome back, (PlayerName)! #line:ch005_belau_again2_58
Emma:Hey, are you feeling alright? You seemed a bit distant when we separated in town. With everything that's happened, especially regarding Noah and your new title as a 'hero', we might've been overly enthusiastic when you needed a moment. I apologize if we seemed insensitive... #line:ch005_belau_again2_59
