Emma:Hello? Any Wagners around? Any Legendary heroes from the Wagner family? Hellooo? #line:ch5noahagain1_4
<<wait 2.0>>
Emma:...I guess that was a silly idea. Nobody's answering... #line:ch5noahagain1_5

Noah:I know, I know... I messed up. I'm truly sorry. #line:ch5noahagain1_26

Noah: .. Alright, are you feeling better now? I know it's a lot to take in, but we need to chat.  #line:ch5noahagain1_43
Noah:This isn't a place for lively folks like you to linger for too long. If you stay here too much, you might not be able to leave. #line:ch5noahagain1_44
Emma:Uh, yeah... okay... #line:ch5noahagain1_45

Noah: Firstly, (PlayerName), Emma, I regret making you both worry so much. I'm truly sorry. #line:ch5noahagain1_46
Noah:...Judging by your reactions, you never received my letters, did you? #line:ch5noahagain1_47
Noah:I penned a few notes during my journey and had my messenger deliver them to you... #line:ch5noahagain1_48
Emma:A letter, you say? #line:ch5noahagain1_49
Emma:We never got any letters. You can imagine how worried we were, right? #line:ch5noahagain1_50
===
title: ch5_noah_again1_21
tags:

Noah: I know messages can get lost when passed from one messenger to another. But not receiving even one? #line:ch5noahagain1_51
Noah: I didn't expect such negligence. Something must've gone wrong...  #line:ch5noahagain1_52
Noah:But let's not dwell on that. Since you didn't get my letters, I'll fill you in now. #line:ch5noahagain1_53
Noah:I left home because I sensed something off with the increasing demon activity in recent years.  #line:ch5noahagain1_54
Noah:I wanted to investigate it. Initially, it was just a gut feeling, so I only told you I'd be gone for a bit. #line:ch5noahagain1_55
Noah: I hoped my letters would keep you informed, but I never imagined things would turn out like this. #line:ch5noahagain1_56
Emma:Turns out, the surge in demon sightings is because the Demon King, sealed 300 years ago, has awakened. Worse yet, this revived Demon King somehow managed to capture Princess Olivia from Elrod Castle... #line:ch5noahagain1_57
That's why the King sent us on a quest:to defeat the Demon King and save the princess. #line:ch5noahagain1_58
Noah:I gathered as much from Leonhardt. #line:ch5noahagain1_59
Emma:You mean the Knight Commander?  So, Noah, you ventured to the forest where those knights were battling too? #line:ch5noahagain1_60
===

Noah:I went to various places, piecing together information, and ultimately found myself there. #line:ch5noahagain1_61
Noah:The first thing I did was to go in the forrest and help out a little bit. Then I discovered that Leonhardt was in command of the troops there, and they shared a lot with me. #line:ch5noahagain1_62
Emma:Is it possible that you, Noah and the Knight Commander know each other...? #line:ch5noahagain1_63
Noah:Oh, Leonhardt is my student. #line:ch5noahagain1_64
Noah:Leonhardt hails from a distinguished family of knights who have served royalty for generations. #line:ch5noahagain1_65
Noah:When Leonhardt was about 15 or 16 years old, the parents sought my guidance, being a descendant of the legendary hero, to instruct in swordplay and magic. #line:ch5noahagain1_66
Noah:Leonhardt, hailing from a renowned family, was more adept with the sword and more intelligent than peers. Equally noticeable was an immense pride and a confident demeanor. Such confidence was remarkable. #line:ch5noahagain1_67
Emma:What a serious-looking Knight Commander... #line:ch5noahagain1_68
Noah: When I was to instruct Leonhardt, Leonhardt told me there was little to learn from someone like me, a descendant of a legendary hero.  #line:ch5noahagain1_69
Noah: I, not being one to back down easily, made sure to challenge those assumptions while being very harsh. Luckily, Leonhardt is an eager learner, reflected on past actions, and matured beautifully. The parents expressed their gratitude to me as well. #line:ch5noahagain1_70
Noah:I miss Leonhardt. Such a competitive spirit; there were instances of frustration when magic didn't come easily, leading to genuine emotional cries. #line:ch5noahagain1_71
Emma:Noah... can you discuss such matters so casually when Leonhardt isn't present? #line:ch5noahagain1_72
Noah:Oops. Let's stay on track. I've been assisting Leonhardt and the knights, just like old times... #line:ch5noahagain1_73
Noah:One night while I was on guard duty, I got ambushed and then ended up here. #line:ch5noahagain1_74
Emma:! #line:ch5noahagain1_75
Emma:So, you were attacked by a demon, Noah...! #line:ch5noahagain1_76
Noah: No, I can sense demons from a distance because I'm well-aware of their presence.  #line:ch5noahagain1_77
Noah:Yet that time, I didn't see or sense anything. It happened too quickly.  #line:ch5noahagain1_78
Noah:I believe it wasn't just a demon or the Demon King... possibly, there's an even bigger and unknown force at play. Stay on your toes. #line:ch5noahagain1_79

Emma:Wait... so there's a possibility of encountering something even stranger? #line:ch5noahagain1_80
Noah:It's a possibility. Just be cautious. #line:ch5noahagain1_81
Emma:Noah, you always seem to have a gut feeling that's on point. #line:ch5noahagain1_82
Emma:I'll remember that. First, there's a guy in that forest, where the Knight Commander is, that we need to deal with. #line:ch5noahagain1_83
Noah:You mean General Ogre? No one could beat him while I was there. #line:ch5noahagain1_84

Emma: Right. We tried to help with the battle, but the Knight Commander said (PlayerName) has some hidden power. We need to awaken that power before we can really help. #line:ch5noahagain1_85
Noah:I mentioned the same thing to Leonhardt before I arrived here. If you run into them, pass on the message. #line:ch5noahagain1_86
Noah:Leonhardt, as a Knight Commander, leads many soldiers and possesses an exceptional ability to discern individuals. Likely, Leonhardt noticed (PlayerName) and recognized the latent power within. #line:ch5noahagain1_87
Emma:We checked with the Great Church. They said to get this hidden power, we need the Sword of the Legendary Hero, also known as the Demon King Killer Sword. So, we came here to ask if any ancestors knew where to find it. #line:ch5noahagain1_88
Noah:But instead of ancestors, you found a dad you didn't think would be here. #line:ch5noahagain1_89
Noah:Hmm... that sword... I remember my dad, your grandpa, mentioning it. He said it was a special treasure hidden deep inside a temple. #line:ch5noahagain1_90
Emma:A temple...? I think of the Great Church when you say that. But they would know if they had a legendary sword, so it doesn't match up. #line:ch5noahagain1_91

Noah:If what grandpa said is right, then the Legendary Hero's sword might be in those ruins. #line:ch5noahagain1_93

Emma:I'm still surprised you, Noah and the Knight Commander knew each other. #line:ch5noahagain1_94
Emma:I wish Knight Commander had just told us instead of hiding it. #line:ch5noahagain1_95
Noah:Leonhardt probably wanted to be the Knight Commander around you, not just someone who knew me. #line:ch5noahagain1_96
Noah:Besides... given Leonhardt's personality, there's a possibility the Knight Commander may think mydeath was on account of them, possibly being too burdened by that thought to share it with you all. #line:ch5noahagain1_97
Noah:(PlayerName), if you see Leonhardt again, reassure the Knight Commander that there's no cause for concern. #line:ch5noahagain1_98

Noah: ...(PlayerName), you've changed a lot. You're so much stronger than the last time I saw you. #line:ch5noahagain1_99

Noah:Sorry, I just can't help but lighten the mood. #line:ch5noahagain1_103
