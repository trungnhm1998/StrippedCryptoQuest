Emma:Excuse me, can you sharpen this sword for us? #line:LegendBlacksmith_2

Blacksmith:Wow! This sword's in bad shape! What happened? #line:LegendBlacksmith_3
Blacksmith:Come on, this thing will fall apart and break if you sharpen it, you'd be better off getting a new one than trying to fix this. #line:LegendBlacksmith_4
Emma:Yes, we know but it's special to us. Isn't there any way to fix it? #line:LegendBlacksmith_5
Blacksmith:No way! No way! It's beyond repair! #line:LegendBlacksmith_6
Blacksmith:I mean, if it's very important, why is it so torn up? Take care of your own things!!!! #line:LegendBlacksmith_7
Emma:There's a story behind it! But it's really important! #line:LegendBlacksmith_8

Blacksmith:Even if that is the case,  I can't do what I can't do...! #line:LegendBlacksmith_9
Blacksmith:Ahh....Umm....Wait... I heard something from other blacksmiths. #line:LegendBlacksmith_10

Emma:What!? Tell us! #line:LegendBlacksmith_11
<<wait 1.0>>
Blacksmith:There's a legendary blacksmith rumored to be in this country. #line:LegendBlacksmith_12
Blacksmith:blades that slice through stone as if it's water, hammers that make the ground tremble, arrows that can pierce a dragon soaring in the sky, and armor that can soften the fiercest blows into a gentle breeze and turn spells into mist. #line:LegendBlacksmith_13
Blacksmith:The story goes that a clueless woman once approached him to sharpen her old kitchen knife. #line:LegendBlacksmith_14
Blacksmith:After he did and told her that it will be the sharpest thing she will every try, she tried slicing a carrot, and it was so sharp that she cut through the carrot, the board below, and even the table itself. #line:LegendBlacksmith_15
Blacksmith:In her panicked state, she tried to piece everything back together, and to her astonishment, the precision of the cut was so clean that it was easy to seamlessly put everything back to their original state. #line:LegendBlacksmith_16

Emma:That's a tale I've never come across before! That's amazing! #line:LegendBlacksmith_17
Blacksmith:Assuming it's not just a tale. #line:LegendBlacksmith_18
Emma:If these rumors hold any truth, where might this legendary blacksmith be at? #line:LegendBlacksmith_19
Emma:Are there any whispers about his whereabouts? #line:LegendBlacksmith_20
Blacksmith:There's talk that he was invited to serve the royal family, but he declined quite brashly, upset the knights, and vanished. #line:LegendBlacksmith_21
Blacksmith:Some say he grew weary of seeing the harm his creations caused, or was disheartened that no one could truly wield his masterpieces.... #line:LegendBlacksmith_22
Blacksmith:But if someone of his stature wanted to go into hiding, perhaps he'd be in a place like a prison town? #line:LegendBlacksmith_23
Emma:It seems like that's the only lead we have right now, so we might as well look into it. #line:LegendBlacksmith_24

Blacksmith:Just remember, I'm only sharing what I've heard. Don't get upset if you don't find him there. #line:LegendBlacksmith_25
Emma:We know, we appreciate you telling us about that intriguing story. #line:LegendBlacksmith_26

Emma:Now that we're here at Tether, let's investigate the blacksmith's story about the legendary blacksmith. #line:LegendBlacksmith_27

Bravo:Where should we begin our search? #line:LegendBlacksmith_28
Emma:Honestly, I'm not even sure where to start... #line:LegendBlacksmith_29

Emma:Hey, what's wrong? Do you have a lead on this? Right, Patrick is in Tether! Maybe we can go ask him. #line:LegendBlacksmith_30

Emma:True, Patrick did mention joining the volunteer army. He might have some useful insights. #line:LegendBlacksmith_31
Emma:Let's head to the volunteer armies' gathering place. #line:LegendBlacksmith_32
Bravo:Are we going to see that phony guy again? #line:LegendBlacksmith_33
Emma:Yes, we're heading to Patrick's place â€” the ex-pickpocket that (PlayerName) seems to have taken quite a liking to... #line:LegendBlacksmith_34
Emma:Did Patrick mention where the volunteer force gathers? #line:LegendBlacksmith_35

Emma:Ah, Patrick marked it on the map. We'll locate it soon, and then let's head out. #line:LegendBlacksmith_36

Patrick:Oh my, if it isn't my dear! Don't tell me you came all this way just to visit me!? #line:LegendBlacksmith_37

Emma:Yes,yes,yes, we came to ask a few questions to you, Patrick and the members of the Volunteer Army. #line:LegendBlacksmith_38
Patrick:What do you wish to know? #line:LegendBlacksmith_39

Patrick:Ah, the legendary blacksmith. #line:LegendBlacksmith_40
Volunteer Army A:I don't know, man. #line:LegendBlacksmith_41
Volunteer Army B:...Now that you mention it...maybe I've met that guy before... #line:LegendBlacksmith_42
Emma:What!? Really !? #line:LegendBlacksmith_43
Volunteer Army B:After a job vanquishing demons, a seemingly intoxicated and mysterious elder approached me. #line:LegendBlacksmith_44
Volunteer Army B:Noticing the sword at my side, he commented on its condition and, feeling generous, offered to sharpen it for me... #line:LegendBlacksmith_45
Volunteer Army B:After handing it back to me, I was amazed. The blade had transformed, gleaming with sharpness. It was so razor-edged that with a gentle swing, I could have effortlessly sliced through a golem's neck. #line:LegendBlacksmith_46
Emma:Wow...just like the rumors! #line:LegendBlacksmith_47

Patrick:So what about that sword? Do you still have it? #line:LegendBlacksmith_48
Volunteer Army B:The other day, I nearly sliced my leg off when I accidentally dropped that sword. It terrified me so much that I stashed it deep in the storage. #line:LegendBlacksmith_49
Volunteer Army B:I'm too petrified to even wield it now. I wish it would just dull and rust over time. #line:LegendBlacksmith_50
Volunteer Army A:A potent weapon is meaningless if one cannot wield it proficiently... #line:LegendBlacksmith_51
Emma:I'm convinced that man is the legendary blacksmith! Tell me mister, where did you come across him? #line:LegendBlacksmith_52
Volunteer Army B:If I recall correctly, it was at (PlayerName). Oh, and that peculiar old man had a headband on. You might recognize him by that. #line:LegendBlacksmith_53
Patrick:I'll mark down the location of that region, and my dear can search for a landmarked figure in that vicinity. #line:LegendBlacksmith_54
Emma:Thank you for sharing that information with us! #line:LegendBlacksmith_55
Emma:Let's set out to locate the legendary blacksmith with the clues we have! #line:LegendBlacksmith_56

Patrick:You're departing so soon? I'll truly miss you. #line:LegendBlacksmith_57
Patrick:My dear, take good care of yourself! You're always welcome here! #line:LegendBlacksmith_58
Patrick:Oh! And remember, if you ever come across a lucrative deal, I'm your guy~! #line:LegendBlacksmith_59

Emma:Excuse me, sir... are you the famed legendary blacksmith? #line:LegendBlacksmith_60
Legendary Blacksmith:What? ... I've got a hangover and I'm not in the best mood, so leave me be. #line:LegendBlacksmith_61
Emma:If you're not denying it, that means you're him, right? #line:LegendBlacksmith_62
Emma:There's a favor we urgently need to ask. We're willing to compensate you, of course... #line:LegendBlacksmith_63
Legendary Blacksmith:Not interested. Not today. #line:LegendBlacksmith_64

Legendary Blacksmith:Oh?.... Hey, hey. That's a special sword you have there! #line:LegendBlacksmith_66
Emma:I knew it? No one's ever seen such a battered sword like this before... #line:LegendBlacksmith_67
Legendary Blacksmith:You misunderstand, I'm saying this sword is an amazing sword! #line:LegendBlacksmith_68
Legendary Blacksmith:Only a novice would dismiss this masterpiece as mere junk. #line:LegendBlacksmith_69
Legendary Blacksmith:How did you come to possess this? It's a blend of materials I've never seen...And there's something more...They've incorporated that element too...Wow, they even use that here... #line:LegendBlacksmith_70
Legendary Blacksmith:And there's something more...They've incorporated that element too...Wow, they even use that here... #line:LegendBlacksmith_71
Emma:You recognize its exceptional nature, then. Would you consider restoring this amazing sword for us? #line:LegendBlacksmith_72
Legendary Blacksmith:I would like to, but I cannot do it. #line:LegendBlacksmith_73
Legendary Blacksmith:It's not wear and tear on this blade; it's a curse. Lifting curses isn't a blacksmith's job. #line:LegendBlacksmith_74
Emma:Wait, you're saying this dark tarnish isn't rust but a curse!? #line:LegendBlacksmith_75
Blacksmith:Seems you couldn't even discern that. #line:LegendBlacksmith_76
Blacksmith:Perhaps a simple shrine wouldn't suffice. Maybe it needs the intervention of the Grand Church. Though, I can't be certain. #line:LegendBlacksmith_77
Emma:I never realized that what I deemed age-old grime and rust was actually a curse.... #line:LegendBlacksmith_78
Emma:Seems we're headed back to the Grand Church. #line:LegendBlacksmith_79

Emma:Thank you for your guidance, sir. #line:LegendBlacksmith_80
Emma:Oh, by the way, there are countless tales about you, aren't there? Of how the royal family wanted you exclusively for their weaponry, of your anger when you refused, #line:LegendBlacksmith_81
Emma:of your sorrow as your creations harmed others, or of your disappointment with the world where no one could match your expertise... #line:LegendBlacksmith_82
Legendary Blacksmith:Ah, rumors might be flawed, but in this case, they're all true. #line:LegendBlacksmith_83
Legendary Blacksmith:You all seem a fun bunch, and it's been a while since I've been genuinely intrigued by anything! Consider my services a token of gratitude. #line:LegendBlacksmith_84
Legendary Blacksmith:Bring me the right materials, and I'll forge the finest weapons and armor for you. And if there's something you hold dear, trust me to take care of it. #line:LegendBlacksmith_85
Legendary Blacksmith:And if there's something you hold dear, trust me to take care of it. #line:LegendBlacksmith_86
Emma:Really? Thank you Mister! #line:LegendBlacksmith_87
Legendary Blacksmith:Oh and once the curse is lifted, do show me that sword. As a blacksmith, I would like to see that sword in its true form. #line:LegendBlacksmith_88
