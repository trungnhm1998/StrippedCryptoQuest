Olivia:Well, that's good to hear. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_31
Olivia:Should you feel tired, we've arranged a room for you to rest. Just let any of our castle staff know. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_32
Emma:Thank you very much. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_33
Emma:While we're still bursting with energy, how are you holding up, Princess Olivia? #line:ch6oliviarescue1_34
Emma:Being held captive by the Demon King must have taken a toll on you. It must have been a trying time filled with worries... #line:ch6oliviarescue1_35
Olivia:I was confined for quite a while, but I believe what you all endured during your journey was far more challenging. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_36
Olivia:Please, don't worry over me. Just being back in the castle, surrounded by support, brings immense relief. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_37
Emma:Everyone was worried about the Princess, so I'm really glad to see you safe and sound like this. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_38

Emma:Princess Olivia! Are you okay!? #line:ch6oliviarescue1_51
Olivia:I... I apologize. I felt a sudden wave of dizziness... #line:ch6oliviarescue1_52
Emma: You've just returned to the castle after such an ordeal. Maybe the festivities and the drink took a toll on you. The King and Queen are nearby; maybe it's best if you take a moment to rest. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_53
Olivia:I suppose the joy of finally being at a lively party after such a long time got the better of me. It's a bit embarrassing in front of all of you. I'll take the Fairy's advice and return to my parents' side for some rest. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_54
Emma:Yes. Please take care as you go. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_55
Olivia:Thank you. Now if you'll excuse me. Please continue to enjoy yourselves. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_56
Olivia:...It's going to be lively for a while now that we've defeated the Demon King, but when things settle down, I'd like to thank you again for your kindness. #line:ch6oliviarescue1_57
