Leonhardt: So, this is the sword of the legendary hero. #line:ch5battleground1_4
Emma: Yes! we retrieved this sword and the hidden power within {GetPlayerName()} was awakened! #line:ch5battleground1_5

Leonhardt: Having recognized and harnessed your inherent power, you truly embody the essence of a hero. Doubts should now be a relic of the past. #line:ch5battleground1_8
Leonhardt: I'll share with you now what I initially held back. #line:ch5battleground1_9

Leonhardt: Recently, your father journeyed to this battleground under my jurisdiction. #line:ch5battleground1_11
Leonhardt: Our shared history saw him aiding us in combat at this location. #line:ch5battleground1_12
Leonhardt: However... #line:ch5battleground1_13
Emma: Noah was killed while guarding the encampment at night, right? #line:ch5battleground1_14
Leonhardt: Ah, you were already privy to this? #line:ch5battleground1_15
Emma: Yeah, he told us himself. #line:ch5battleground1_16
Leonhardt: A face-to-face encounter? What are you insinuating? Is it truly Noah? You may have confused him with another individual. #line:ch5battleground1_17

Leonhardt: Can you travel to the 'Realm of the Dead' and communicate with Lord Noah's spirit... Is that even possible? #line:ch5battleground1_18
Leonhardt: Indeed... I apologize. My inadequacy feels as though it led to your father's demise. #line:ch5battleground1_19

Emma: That's not your fault, Knight Commander. Noah also told us to tell you not to worry about it, because he was sure that you would think so. #line:ch5battleground1_20

Leonhardt: For Noah's sake, for our comrades who've fallen in battle, for those still standing, and for the world's future...  #line:ch5battleground1_24

Leonhardt: Are you prepared for battle? #line:ch5battleground2_1
Leonhardt: We're confronting an army commanded by the formidable General Ogre. Have you made your preperations for this challenge? #line:ch5battleground2_2
Talk #line:ch5battleground2_3
Emma: Yes, this sword made this him even stronger, but if the Knight Commander had it, wouldn't it make you stronger too? #line:ch5battleground2_4
Leonhardt: I believe that legendary sword is selective about its wielder. #line:ch5battleground2_5
Leonhardt: If I were to grasp the sword, either it would remain dormant or... worse, a catastrophe might ensue. #line:ch5battleground2_6
Emma: Oh, wow... This is a surprisingly scary sword... #line:ch5battleground2_7
Leonhardt: Indeed, that sword is exclusively for Heroes. #line:ch5battleground2_8
Leonhardt: {GetPlayerName()}, I understand the weight of the 'hero' title upon you, but certain tasks are destined for those who carry the Blood of the Brave lineage.  #line:ch5battleground2_9
Leonhardt: We're relying on your strength. #line:ch5battleground2_9_2
YES #line:ch5battleground2_10

Bravo: I see you've figured out that I'm not a dog, but you're not quite there yet! I'm a werewolf! #line:ch5battleground2_19
Leonhardt: Excuse my misjudgement, but it's not often one encounters a werewolf. #line:ch5battleground2_20

Leonhardt: Is something amiss? #line:ch5battleground6_10
Emma: The Knight Commander is a woman?! #line:ch5battleground6_11
Leonhardt: Yes.. And? #line:ch5battleground6_12
Emma: Had you been concealing your true gender all this time? #line:ch5battleground6_13
Emma: Perhaps masquerading as a male made it easier to lead the knights, or maybe there's another reason... #line:ch5battleground6_14
Leonhardt: Not particularly... #line:ch5battleground6_15
Leonhardt: It wasn't my intention to hide my gender... #line:ch5battleground6_16
