Leonhardt:So, this is the sword of the Legendary Hero. #line:ch5battleground1_4
Emma:Yes! we retrieved this sword and the hidden power within {GetPlayerName()} was awakened! #line:ch5battleground1_5
Emma:Now, there's nothing for the Knight Commander to worry about anymore, right? #line:ch5battleground1_6
Leonhardt:Yes. Indeed.... #line:ch5battleground1_7

Leonhardt:Having recognized and harnessed your inherent power, you truly embody the essence of a 'hero'; doubts should now be a relic of the past. #line:ch5battleground1_8
Leonhardt:I'll share with you now what I initially held back. #line:ch5battleground1_9
Leonhardt:Your father and I shared a past. In my youth, he tutored me in both swordsmanship and magic. #line:ch5battleground1_10

Leonhardt:Recently, your father journeyed to this battleground under my jurisdiction. #line:ch5battleground1_11
Leonhardt:Our shared history saw him aiding us in combat at this location. #line:ch5battleground1_12
Leonhardt:However... #line:ch5battleground1_13
Emma:Noah was killed while guarding the encampment at night, right? #line:ch5battleground1_14
Leonhardt:Ah, you were already privy to this? #line:ch5battleground1_15
Emma:Yeah, he told us himself. #line:ch5battleground1_16
Leonhardt:A face-to-face encounter? What are you insinuating? Is it truly Noah? You may have confused him with another individual. #line:ch5battleground1_17

Leonhardt:Can you travel to the 'Realm of the Dead' and communicate with Lord Noah's spirit... is that even possible? #line:ch5battleground1_18
Leonhardt:Indeed... I apologize. My inadequacy feels as though it led to your father's demise. #line:ch5battleground1_19

Emma:That's not your fault, Knight Commander. Noah also told us to tell you not to worry about it, because he was sure that Leonhardt would think so. #line:ch5battleground1_20

Leonhardt:...Thank you for those words. #line:ch5battleground1_21
Leonhardt:Your resolve and spirit are more profound than I had anticipated. #line:ch5battleground1_22
Emma:Hehe, you can count on us! #line:ch5battleground1_23
Leonhardt:For Noah's sake, for our comrades who've fallen in battle, for those still standing, and for the world's future... we must emerge victorious in this fight. #line:ch5battleground1_24

Leonhardt:Are you geared up for battle? #line:ch5battleground2_1
Leonhardt:We're confronting an army commanded by the formidable General Ogre. Have you made your preperations for this challenge? #line:ch5battleground2_2
Talk #line:ch5battleground2_3
Emma:Yes, this sword made this him even stronger, but if the Knight Commander had it, wouldn't it make you stronger too? #line:ch5battleground2_4
Leonhardt:I believe that legendary sword is selective about its wielder. #line:ch5battleground2_5
Leonhardt:If I were to grasp the sword, either it would remain dormant or... worse, a catastrophe might ensue. #line:ch5battleground2_6
Emma:Oh, wow... This is a surprisingly scary sword... #line:ch5battleground2_7
Leonhardt:Indeed, that sword is exclusively for Heroes. #line:ch5battleground2_8
Leonhardt:{GetPlayerName()}, I understand the weight of the 'hero' title upon you, but certain tasks are destined for those who carry the Blood of the Brave lineage. We're relying on your strength. #line:ch5battleground2_9
YES #line:ch5battleground2_10

Leonhardt:Is something amiss? #line:ch5battleground6_10
Emma:The Knight Commander was a woman!? #line:ch5battleground6_11
Leonhardt:Yes..And? #line:ch5battleground6_12
Emma:Had you been concealing your true gender all this time? #line:ch5battleground6_13
