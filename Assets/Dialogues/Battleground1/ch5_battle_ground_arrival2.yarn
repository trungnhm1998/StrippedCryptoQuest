Encampment Soldier: I haven't seen your faces around here before. #line:ch5groundarrival2_3
Encampment Soldier: Don't tell me you wandered in here without proper authorization? #line:ch5groundarrival2_4
Encampment Soldier: No unauthorized personnel are allowed here! #line:ch5groundarrival2_5
Emma: No,no,no, we have the appropriate permissions to be here. #line:ch5groundarrival2_6
Encampment Soldier: Really? You youngsters? You're kidding me, right? #line:ch5groundarrival2_7
Encampment Soldier: Yea... This isn't a playground for the young. #line:ch5groundarrival2_8
Encampment Soldier: This area is dangerous. Leave at once, before you get hurt. #line:ch5groundarrival2_9
Bravo: What? The audacity to speak to my master like that... #line:ch5groundarrival2_10
Emma: Calm down, Bravo. We already have our hands full with the demons. Let's not cause a scene here.  #line:ch5groundarrival2_11
Emma: This is an establishment under the Knight Commander. If we explain ourselves clearly, they should understand. #line:ch5groundarrival2_11_2
Bravo: Are you sure? They don't seem to be understanding, do they? #line:ch5groundarrival2_12
Bravo: Look at them, they look kind of stupid and maybe the lowest of the lowest ranking, right? #line:ch5groundarrival2_13
Emma: ... Yea, this feels somewhat tense... #line:ch5groundarrival2_14
Emma: B.... But we still need to clarify, right? #line:ch5groundarrival2_15
Encampment Soldier: Hey! We're right here, we can hear everything! #line:ch5groundarrival2_16
Encampment Soldier: You're seriously picking a fight with us? #line:ch5groundarrival2_17
Encampment Soldier: Understand this â€“ we serve directly under Knight Commander Leonhardt! #line:ch5groundarrival2_18
Emma: Uh oh, they heard every word! #line:ch5groundarrival2_19
Emma: Wow! Wait, wait, wait, calm down, misters, I'm sorry, but we're really....! #line:ch5groundarrival2_20
???: The descendant of the legendary hero and his friends. They're on a quest to defeat the demons, ordered by our very own King,  #line:ch5groundarrival2_21
???: and they've come here for that very reason. #line:ch5groundarrival2_21_2
Emma: What? #line:ch5groundarrival2_22

Encampment Soldiers: Com...Commander Leonhardt!? #line:ch5groundarrival2_23

Leonhardt: You seem to be the newer recruits here. #line:ch5groundarrival2_24
Leonhardt: While it's commendable to be vigilant about outsiders, I must say your conduct doesn't align with the principles of knighthood.  #line:ch5groundarrival2_25
Leonhardt: Be mindful of your behavior henceforth. #line:ch5groundarrival2_25_2
Encampment Soldiers: Ye..Yes. Understood! #line:ch5groundarrival2_26
Leonhardt: If a dispute arises, handle it under your own name. If you were directly under my command, I doubt such trivial quarrels would occur. #line:ch5groundarrival2_27
Leonhardt: I'll take it from here with this party. Return to your designated positions. #line:ch5groundarrival2_28
Encampment Soldiers: Ye.... Yes. Of Course! #line:ch5groundarrival2_29

Leonhardt: I apologize for the behavior of my soldiers. #line:ch5groundarrival2_30
Emma: Ah, the famous Knight Commander! It's an honor to meet you so soon. #line:ch5groundarrival2_31

Leonhardt: Formalities still dictate the sharing of names, regardless of one's reputation. #line:ch5groundarrival2_32
Leonhardt: Allow me to reintroduce myself. I am Leonhardt, Knight Commander of Elrod Castle. #line:ch5groundarrival2_33
Leonhardt: I've been informed about the incident at the Cardano clinic. #line:ch5groundarrival2_34
Leonhardt:First and foremost, thank you for assisting and saving the life of one of our soldiers. #line:ch5groundarrival2_34_2

Leonhardt: So, {GetPlayerName()}, you must be the heir to the legendary hero. #line:ch5groundarrival2_35
Leonhardt: ... Many tales have been told, and indeed, you bear a striking resemblance to that person... #line:ch5groundarrival2_36
Emma: What? What did you say? #line:ch5groundarrival2_37
Leonhardt: No, it's nothing. #line:ch5groundarrival2_38
Leonhardt: My subordinate also mentioned your intention to join us on this front. Is that true? #line:ch5groundarrival2_39
===

Leonhardt: Indeed, as my subordinate may have conveyed, our forces are stretched thin.  #line:ch5groundarrival2_40
Leonhardt: We're losing both numbers and the caliber of fighters needed for this battle. #line:ch5groundarrival2_40_2
Leonhardt: Your presence here truly offers a glimmer of hope in these trying times. #line:ch5groundarrival2_41

Leonhardt: ... However, as it stands, I hesitate to request your assistance right now. #line:ch5groundarrival2_42
Emma: Wait, what? But you're really need of fighters, aren't you? #line:ch5groundarrival2_43
Leonhardt: Undoubtedly, with the lineage of a legendary hero, your prowess in both swordsmanship and magic likely surpasses many of our own. #line:ch5groundarrival2_44
Emma: Exactly! He's very strong! #line:ch5groundarrival2_45
Leonhardt: ...Yet, that's precisely the extent of my perception of you right now. #line:ch5groundarrival2_46
Leonhardt: While you are stronger than the others, currently, your strength might be on par with mine, at most. #line:ch5groundarrival2_47
Emma: So, that's not good enough? #line:ch5groundarrival2_48
Leonhardt: The General Ogre leads a horde of demons on this battleground. #line:ch5groundarrival2_49
Leonhardt: Drawing power directly from the Demon King, his strength is unique and unparalleled among his demonic kin. #line:ch5groundarrival2_50
Leonhardt: Given our current strength, combined with yours, our chances of defeating General Ogre and his horde are 50-50.... Perhaps even less than that. #line:ch5groundarrival2_51
Emma:  But even with the slimmest chance, I'm willing to place my bets on us... #line:ch5groundarrival2_52
Leonhardt: Your ultimate goal is to vanquish the Demon King and rescue the princess. #line:ch5groundarrival2_53
Leonhardt: If you fail or barely succeed here, how do you plan to face foes even more formidable than General Ogre? #line:ch5groundarrival2_53_2
Emma: Ye... Yes, the Knight Commander does speak the truth... #line:ch5groundarrival2_54
Leonhardt: Up until now, perhaps your method has worked, but this time requires a different approach. #line:ch5groundarrival2_55
Leonhardt: Earlier, I mentioned 'you right now' repeatedly. Do you grasp its significance? #line:ch5groundarrival2_56

Leonhardt: ... {GetPlayerName()}, there lies dormant within you an immense power yet to be awakened. #line:ch5groundarrival2_57
Leonhardt: While you might surpass many and rival me, the Knight Commander, there's a unique and special power within you that's incomparable. #line:ch5groundarrival2_58
Emma: Special power...? #line:ch5groundarrival2_59
===

Leonhardt: Such power definitely resides in you. It's crucial that you unlock it. #line:ch5groundarrival2_60
Leonhardt: Not merely as the descendant of a legendary hero but to truly claim the mantle of a hero yourself. #line:ch5groundarrival2_61
Emma: But how do you expect him to suddenly awaken such power? #line:ch5groundarrival2_62
Emma: Knight Commander, if you're emphasizing this issue so strongly, you must have some solutions, right?" #line:ch5groundarrival2_63
Leonhardt: ... Sadly, my vision only goes this far. #line:ch5groundarrival2_64
Emma: So, after sharing all this, it's a bit surprising you don't have the answers... #line:ch5groundarrival2_65
Leonhardt: I, too, don't have complete knowledge of everything. #line:ch5groundarrival2_66
Leonhardt: Being a direct descendant of the legendary hero, mere rigorous training might not suffice. #line:ch5groundarrival2_67
Leonhardt:  The Great Church should have texts about the 'Legendary Hero'. #line:ch5groundarrival2_67_2
Emma: Understood. We'll ask the Archbishop then. #line:ch5groundarrival2_68

Emma: But will you and the Knights manage in the meantime? The situation here seems quite critical. #line:ch5groundarrival2_69
Leonhardt: Your very presence, as the heir to the legendary hero, will undoubtedly uplift the spirits of the Knights. #line:ch5groundarrival2_70
Leonhardt:  With hope on our side, we can persevere. #line:ch5groundarrival2_70_2

Leonhardt: So you'll harness this greater power and return to aid us... I see.. #line:ch5groundarrival2_71
Leonhardt: I regret having to ask this of you after you've journeyed so far, but for the future battles, please understand.  #line:ch5groundarrival2_72
Leonhardt:When you return, I hope to witness the true might of the Legendary Hero within you. #line:ch5groundarrival2_72_2

Leonhardt: My men await. I must take my leave. #line:ch5groundarrival2_73
Emma: The Knight Commander is very busy. #line:ch5groundarrival2_74
Emma: Our next destination should be the Great Church. We need to unlock that latent power quickly and return here. #line:ch5groundarrival2_75
Leonhardt: Yes, I'll be anticipating your return. #line:ch5groundarrival2_76

Leonhardt: ...He looked a lot like that man.... #line:ch5groundarrival2_77
Leonhardt: I'm sure he will awaken his hidden powers and come back to us soon. #line:ch5groundarrival2_78
