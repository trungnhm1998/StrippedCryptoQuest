Hades:Hey, welcome back. #line:ch6demoncastle2_1
Hades:.......Great! You secured that thing perfectly!....Good job! #line:ch6demoncastle2_2
Hades:That should significantly boost your strength against demons. Facing him should now be more manageable. #line:ch6demoncastle2_3

Demon King:Since your birth, you've carried a unique lineage, a distinct power... Whenever the world faces peril, you rise against it. Is that truly your fate? Is this world you seek to save, and that woman you cherish, truly worth it? Do all your actions truly stem from your own desires? Answer me. #line:ch6demoncastle2_34
YES #line:ch6demoncastle2_35
Demon King:I understand now. You're a naive fool who understands little. Your journey ends here. #line:ch6demoncastle2_36
NO #line:ch6demoncastle2_37
Demon King:In a strange way, you might be the closest being to me. #line:ch6demoncastle2_38
Demon King:It's a pity that your journey might end here, but after coming this far, a battle is inevitable. #line:ch6demoncastle2_39
I don't know #line:ch6demoncastle2_40
Demon King:Centuries from now, will there be others who question their path? #line:ch6demoncastle2_41
