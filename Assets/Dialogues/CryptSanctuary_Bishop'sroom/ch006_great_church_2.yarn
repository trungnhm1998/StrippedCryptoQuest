Roman:I'm relieved to hear that. #line:ch006_great_church_26
Roman:But arriving at the Crypto Sanctuary in such a battered state... What transpired? #line:ch006_great_church_27

Emma:You see, as we ventured through the Demon King's castle, we encountered someone namedHades. He's part of the inner circle of the Demon King. #line:ch006_great_church_28
Emma:He was incredibly formidable, and we eventually had to retreat... #line:ch006_great_church_29
Roman:I see, so that's the ordeal you faced. #line:ch006_great_church_30
Roman:Having an adversary of such strength just before confronting the Demon King is concerning. #line:ch006_great_church_31
Emma:Archbishop, do know anything about Hades? #line:ch006_great_church_32
Roman:Hades... Hmmm... That name doesn't ring any bells for me.... #line:ch006_great_church_33
Roman:It's not mentioned in the sacred texts of the Great Church. Could he be a demon conjured by the Demon Lord himself? #line:ch006_great_church_34
Emma:It seems even you, the Archbishop, aren't familiar with him? #line:ch006_great_church_35
Roman:I apologize for my lack of knowledge on the matter... #line:ch006_great_church_36
Emma:No, please don't apologize. #line:ch006_great_church_37
Emma:Well, I've heard that it might be a great idea to visit the Cursed Mansion as it might hold some tools of significance. #line:ch006_great_church_38
Emma:Are you familiar with it, Archbishop? I'm hesitant because the source of this information isn't entirely trustworthy... #line:ch006_great_church_39
Roman:Ah, yes, I'm familiar with the Cursed Mansion. I can provide you with the details you seek. In fact, there's a specific tool from the mansion that could be of utmost importance. #line:ch006_great_church_40
Emma:What, oh, that information was real...? #line:ch006_great_church_41
Roman:Indeed, the Cursed Mansion can be found to the most northeastern part on the map, nestled deep within the forest. Legend has it that the mansion was once home to a powerful Witch. Originally a skilled mage, she became obsessed with the quest for immortality.  #line:ch006_great_church_42
Roman:Through countless experiments on human beings, her mind and body deteriorated, driving her to madness and transforming her into a monstrous being. #line:ch006_great_church_43
Roman:The church has dispatched many to confront her on multiple occasions. However, every time, we were repelled, finding ourselves unable to defeat her... #line:ch006_great_church_44

Roman: Next, I'll shall share about the item at the Cursed Mansion. Historical accounts suggest that a revered saint once ventured into the Cursed Mansion, seeking to kill the malevolent Witch. #line:ch006_great_church_45
Emma:A Saint that goes to kill a Witch... #line:ch006_great_church_46
Emma:This Saint was known for his profound compassion, unable to harm even the smallest insect. He was the sort of individual who would tirelessly approach even the gravest sinner, offering redemption. #line:ch006_great_church_47
Emma:Yet tragedy struck when the Witch abducted the Saint's only daughter, subjecting her to dark experiments. #line:ch006_great_church_48
Emma:The outcome was horrible; the once vibrant young woman was reduced to an unrecognizable, grotesque mass. It was only the presence of her cherished bracelet that helped identify her... #line:ch006_great_church_49
Emma:.... #line:ch006_great_church_50
Roman:Upon witnessing the horrifying transformation of his daughter, the Saint was consumed by a mix of profound sorrow, rage, and desperation. To confront the Witch, he harnessed pure light, crafting the 'Ring of Destruction' from it. Legends say that during its creation, the world was plunged into darkness for seven days as all light was absorbed. #line:ch006_great_church_51
Roman:However, the power of the 'Ring of Destruction' was beyond even the Saint's expectations. When he tried to wield it against the Witch, its light energy burned him, resulting in his tragic death before he could even kill her. #line:ch006_great_church_52
Roman:As the tales go, even the evil Witch couldn't handle or destroy the 'Ring of Destruction'. Thus, it remains untouched within the confines of the Cursed Mansion. #line:ch006_great_church_53
Roman:That very artifact is the one you must seek within the Cursed Mansion. #line:ch006_great_church_54

Emma:It's tragic how he was burned to death. His overwhelming desire to avenge his daughter pushed him to create something beyond his own control. It's quite sad... #line:ch006_great_church_55
Roman:Perhaps the tale was preserved to teach us not to succumb to anger. The Saint may have faltered, but perhaps Mr. {GetPlayerName()}, with his heroic spirit, can harness and command the immense energy of that 'Ring of Destruction'. #line:ch006_great_church_56
Roman:With the 'Ring of Destruction', based on the information gathered by Mr. {GetPlayerName()} and the group, we could amplify our strength against the great demons. It might even provide the edge we need to defeat Hades or whatever he truly is. #line:ch006_great_church_57
Emma:...Against the great evil.... #line:ch006_great_church_58
Emma:Then when everyone recovers, let's get ready and head to the Cursed Mansion to get the 'Ring of Destruction'. #line:ch006_great_church_59

Roman:You are drawing nearer to the Demon King's lair. Remember not to overexert yourself. If ever you sense danger, don't hesitate to return to the church for healing. #line:ch006_great_church_60
