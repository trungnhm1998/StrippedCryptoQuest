Roman: I'm relieved to hear that. #line:ch006_great_church_26
Roman: But arriving at the Crypto Sanctuary in such a battered state... What transpired? #line:ch006_great_church_27

Emma: You see, as we ventured through the Demon King's castle, we encountered someone named Hades. He's part of the inner circle of the Demon King. #line:ch006_great_church_28
Emma: He was incredibly strong, and we eventually had to retreat... #line:ch006_great_church_29
Roman: I see, so that's the ordeal you faced. #line:ch006_great_church_30
Roman: Having an adversary of such strength just before confronting the Demon King is concerning. #line:ch006_great_church_31
Emma: Archbishop, do know anything about Hades? #line:ch006_great_church_32
Roman: Hades... Hmmm... That name doesn't ring any bells for me.... #line:ch006_great_church_33
Roman: It's not mentioned in the sacred texts of the Great Church. Could he be a demon conjured by the Demon King himself? #line:ch006_great_church_34
Emma: It seems even you, the Archbishop, don't know who he is? #line:ch006_great_church_35
Roman: I apologize for my lack of knowledge on the matter... #line:ch006_great_church_36
Emma: No, please don't apologize. #line:ch006_great_church_37
Emma: Well, I've heard that it might be a great idea  #line:ch006_great_church_38
Emma: to visit the Cursed Mansion as it might hold some tools of significance. #line:ch006_great_church_38_1
Emma: Archbishop, do you know about this? I'm a bit cautious since the source of the information isn't completely reliable... #line:ch006_great_church_39
Roman: Ah, yes, I'm familiar with the Cursed Mansion. I can provide you with the details you seek.  #line:ch006_great_church_40
Roman: In fact, there's a specific tool from the mansion that could be of utmost importance. #line:ch006_great_church_40_1
Emma: What, oh, that information was real...? #line:ch006_great_church_41
Roman: Indeed, the Cursed Mansion can be found to the most northeastern part on the map, nestled deep within the forest.  #line:ch006_great_church_42
Roman:Legend has it that the mansion was once home to a powerful Witch. Originally a skilled mage, she became obsessed with the quest for immortality.  #line:ch006_great_church_42_1
Roman: Through countless experiments on human beings, her mind and body deteriorated,  #line:ch006_great_church_43
Roman: driving her to madness and transforming her into a monstrous being. #line:ch006_great_church_43_1
Roman: The church has dispatched many to confront her on multiple occasions. #line:ch006_great_church_44
Roman: However, every time, we were repelled, finding ourselves unable to defeat her..." #line:ch006_great_church_44_1

Roman: Next, I'll shall share about the item at the Cursed Mansion.  #line:ch006_great_church_45
Roman: Historical accounts suggest that a revered saint once ventured into the Cursed Mansion, seeking to kill the malevolent Witch. #line:ch006_great_church_45_1
Emma: A Saint that goes to kill a Witch... #line:ch006_great_church_46
Roman: This Saint was known for his profound compassion, unable to harm even the smallest insect.  #line:ch006_great_church_47
Roman: He was the sort of individual who would tirelessly approach even the gravest sinner, offering redemption. #line:ch006_great_church_47_1
Roman: Yet tragedy struck when the Witch abducted the Saint's only daughter, subjecting her to dark experiments. #line:ch006_great_church_48
Roman: The outcome was horrible; the once vibrant young woman was reduced to an unrecognizable, grotesque mass.  #line:ch006_great_church_49
Roman: It was only the presence of her cherished bracelet that helped identify her... #line:ch006_great_church_49_1
Emma: .... #line:ch006_great_church_50
Roman: Upon witnessing the horrifying transformation of his daughter, the Saint was consumed by a mix of profound sorrow, rage, and desperation.  #line:ch006_great_church_51
Roman: To confront the Witch, he harnessed pure light, crafting the 'Ring of Destruction' from it.  #line:ch006_great_church_51_1
Roman: Legends say that during its creation, the world was plunged into darkness for seven days as all light was absorbed. #line:ch006_great_church_51_2
Roman: However, the power of the 'Ring of Destruction' was beyond even the Saint's expectations.  #line:ch006_great_church_52
Roman: When he tried to wield it against the Witch, its light energy burned him, resulting in his tragic death before he could even kill her. #line:ch006_great_church_52_1
Roman: As the tales go, even the evil Witch couldn't handle or destroy the 'Ring of Destruction'.  #line:ch006_great_church_53
Roman: Thus, it remains untouched within the confines of the Cursed Mansion. #line:ch006_great_church_53_1
Roman: That very artifact is the one you must seek within the Cursed Mansion. #line:ch006_great_church_54

Emma: It's tragic how he was burned to death. His overwhelming desire to avenge his daughter pushed him to create something beyond his own control. #line:ch006_great_church_55
Emma:It's quite sad... #line:ch006_great_church_55_1
Roman: Perhaps the tale was preserved to teach us not to succumb to anger. #line:ch006_great_church_56
Roman: The Saint may have faltered, but perhaps Mr. {GetPlayerName()}, with his heroic spirit, can harness and command the immense energy of that 'Ring of Destruction'. #line:ch006_great_church_56_1
Roman: With the 'Ring of Destruction', based on the information gathered by Mr. {GetPlayerName()} and the group, we could amplify our strength against the great demons. #line:ch006_great_church_57
Roman:  It might even provide the edge we need to defeat Hades or whatever he truly is. #line:ch006_great_church_57_1
Emma: ... Against the great evil.... #line:ch006_great_church_58
Emma: Then when everyone recovers, let's get ready and head to the Cursed Mansion to get the 'Ring of Destruction'. #line:ch006_great_church_59

Roman: You are drawing nearer to the Demon King's lair. Remember not to overexert yourself. #line:ch006_great_church_60
Roman:If ever you sense danger, don't hesitate to return to the church for healing. #line:ch006_great_church_60_1
