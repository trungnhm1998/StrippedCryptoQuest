Fairy: Are you done? I'm tired of waiting. #line:ch2postbattlerose1
Bravo: You should at least thank us for killing the demon that was chasing you! #line:ch2postbattlerose2
Bravo: You're acting like an arrogant little worm! #line:ch2postbattlerose3
Fairy: Huh? Well, if I hadn't bumped into you guys, I would have been able to run away from that monster. #line:ch2postbattlerose4
Fairy: If you hadn't been standing there and yelling like idiots, I wouldn't have gotten into trouble. #line:ch2postbattlerose5
Fairy: So you’re the ones who should apologize. #line:ch2postbattlerose6
Fairy: How dare you call me an insect? Unlike fairies, you have only a limited life span, so that makes you guys more like insects. #line:ch2postbattlerose7
Fairy: Now, if you understand everything I said, please apologize to me as soon as possible. #line:ch2postbattlerose8
Bravo: Ugh! What's up with her? She's so small and weak, why does she act so bossy! #line:ch2postbattlerose9
Bravo: Hey, Hero, can I bite her? Can I? #line:ch2postbattlerose10

Bravo: You two know each other? #line:ch2postbattlerose14
Emma: Well... well... since Rosé and I were in the same village in the fairy forest… #line:ch2postbattlerose15
Rosé: ..... #line:ch2postbattlerose16
Emma: ..... #line:ch2postbattlerose17
Rosé: ..Emma. Emma, the odd one out, the outcast, the one who doesn’t fit in our group. #line:ch2postbattlerose18
Rosé: How could you be with these people when you are the one who suddenly disappeared from the fairy forest? #line:ch2postbattlerose19
Emma: It's not what it seems like, this is my precious family and friends… #line:ch2postbattlerose20
Rosé: Oooh… your precious family and friends… #line:ch2postbattlerose21
<<wait  1>>
Emma: Um, by the way, how did you end up here? #line:ch2postbattlerose22
Emma: It's quite a distance from the fairy forest, and I don't think it's safe for you to come here alone… #line:ch2postbattlerose23
Rosé: That's not really any of your business….. #line:ch2postbattlerose24
Rosé: I just came to take a look at this area because it has been cleared up after years of rain, which is something you don’t see everyday. #line:ch2postbattlerose25
Emma: Well, yes. But, like now, demons might attack, and it's dangerous, so I'll help guide you back to the fairy forest… #line:ch2postbattlerose26
Rosé: No thanks. I can go back to the fairy forest on my own, so I don’t really need your help. #line:ch2postbattlerose27
Emma: ..... #line:ch2postbattlerose28
Rosé: ..... #line:ch2postbattlerose29

Emma: Well... well... Rosé used to make me angry in the fairy forest… #line:ch2postbattlerose31

Rosé: What's that? ...... Hmm, oh dear. You really want to guide me home by apologizing to me for bumping into me? #line:ch2postbattlerose33
Rosé: You are admitting that you were in the wrong, right? I didn't do anything wrong. #line:ch2postbattlerose34

Emma: Well then, let's head to the fairy forest to drop off Rosé. #line:ch2postbattlerose40
Emma: The fairy forest is in the southeast area of the Lost Forest, so let's go there first. #line:ch2postbattlerose41
