Bravo:Ahhh, after that rest, I feel so revitalized! Ready to go the extra mile! #line:ch5soldierevent1_2

Villager A:Another person hurt? #line:ch5soldierevent1_5
Villager B:I've heard the Knights are busy clearing up that landslide in the southeastern forest. #line:ch5soldierevent1_6
Villager C:Didn't someone else get injured just the other day? #line:ch5soldierevent1_7
Villager D:How many months has this restoration been ongoing? Surely, the Knights have other tasks than just dealing with that forest... #line:ch5soldierevent1_8

Emma:...Did you catch that? Sounds like the Knights are busy with a landslide in the southeastern forest, and there are a number of injuries. #line:ch5soldierevent1_9

Emma:Given what the villagers are saying, it's odd that they'd deploy Knights just to handle a landslide... Especially when it seems unrelated to their daily lives. It does seem a bit fishy, doesn't it? #line:ch5soldierevent1_10

Soldier A:Hey! Where's the doctor? #line:ch5soldierevent2_1
Soldier B:The bleeding won't stop; he'll be gone if we don't act quickly! #line:ch5soldierevent2_2
Nurse:I've already sent for him; he should be here any moment... #line:ch5soldierevent2_3
Soldier A:We need to act fast, or he's going to bleed out! #line:ch5soldierevent2_4
Soldier B:Hold on! Help is on the way! #line:ch5soldierevent2_5
Emma:It seems they're struggling to find a medic; can I assist? #line:ch5soldierevent2_6

Soldier A:Seriously? We've got a crisis here, back off! #line:ch5soldierevent2_7
Emma:You're having a hard time getting a doctor to show up, aren't you?If it helps, I can use magic to provide immediate first aid and stop the bleeding. #line:ch5soldierevent2_8
Soldier A:Wait, you can perform healing spells? #line:ch5soldierevent2_9
Soldier B:Quickly! Please tend to his injuries! #line:ch5soldierevent2_10

Soldier A:I can see the wound closing up... it's working! #line:ch5soldierevent2_12
Soldier B:Thank goodness, this should stabilize him! #line:ch5soldierevent2_13

Emma:......Alright, the bleeding has stopped. He should not be dying from a bleed out. #line:ch5soldierevent2_14
Emma:This is just a temporary fix; if he exerts himself, the wound might reopen. Please have a doctor to examine it properly later on. #line:ch5soldierevent2_15

Soldier A:I'm so relieved... A little more bleeding, and it could've been fatal... #line:ch5soldierevent2_16
Soldier B:His breathing is more stable now... That's a good sign. #line:ch5soldierevent2_17

Soldier A:I apologize for yelling earlier... Thank you for your help. #line:ch5soldierevent2_18
Soldier B:You have our gratitude. You've truly saved him! #line:ch5soldierevent2_19
Emma:You're welcome. Just glad we could help in time. #line:ch5soldierevent2_20
Soldier A:...... By the way, who exactly are you folks?You seem like travelers. Why did you come to this clinic? #line:ch5soldierevent2_21
Emma:Well, we were hoping to gather some information regarding the Knights... #line:ch5soldierevent2_22

Doctor:Apologies for the wait; I had urgent cases to attend to elsewhere in the village. #line:ch5soldierevent2_23
Emma:Ah, the doctor has arrived.Emma:Once he's properly taken care of, let's continue our discussion. #line:ch5soldierevent2_24

Soldier A:It's good to see you awake and alert.Soldier A:The doctor mentioned that while the wounds were deep, thankfully no vital organs or nerves were harmed. So, it's promising news. #line:ch5soldierevent2_25
Soldier B:You're face's color is looking much better. A bit of rest and keeping the wound clean, and you should be on your feet in no time. #line:ch5soldierevent2_26
Wounded Soldier:I owe you all for getting me here safely. Thank you.Perhaps because I was teetering between life and death... I experienced such vivid dreams. #line:ch5soldierevent2_27
Wounded Soldier:In my dream, I was navigating through a silent forest at night. As I moved ahead, I was drawn to a distant light, much like a moth to a flame. Eventually, this path led me to a serene lake. #line:ch5soldierevent2_28
Wounded Soldier:In the center of the lake, there was an island emitting a soft glow. As I looked closer, I recognized faces of friends who had passed away. They seemed at peace, chatting and laughing amongst themselves. I was about to go to the lake too when I heard you guys calling me frantically from behind. #line:ch5soldierevent2_29
Wounded Soldier:For a moment, I felt that maybe my dead friends were beckoning me to join them. The surrounding luminance grew increasingly intense, reminiscent of dawn, until everything was covered in blinding white light... And then, I awoke, finding myself here in this bed. #line:ch5soldierevent2_30
Soldier A:It's quite scary... to think you were so close to the other side. #line:ch5soldierevent2_31
Soldier B:I'm so relieved we managed to bring you back in time. #line:ch5soldierevent2_32
Wounded Soldier:It was your voices that called me back here, or I might truly have been gone. #line:ch5soldierevent2_33
Soldier A:Maybe being on the brink does lead to such lucid dreams... teetering between life and death. #line:ch5soldierevent2_34
Wounded Soldier:You might be right. The landscape of my dream closely resembled the lake by the forest where we've been battling. Perhaps, due to the countless life-threatening situations there, my mind related it to death and hence, dreamt of it. #line:ch5soldierevent2_35
Emma:It's a relief to see you're okay, Mister. #line:ch5soldierevent2_36

Wounded Soldier:Yes, you're the ones who administered the first aid.It saved my life, thank you.  I owe my life to you guys. #line:ch5soldierevent2_37
Emma:You're Welcome. #line:ch5soldierevent2_38
Emma:Hold on, shouldn't you be resting? Don't exert yourself. #line:ch5soldierevent2_39
Emma:Please, don't strain yourself on our account. Just lie down and talk to us. #line:ch5soldierevent2_40
Wounded Soldier:With the bleeding stopped and the wound sealed, I feel much better. #line:ch5soldierevent2_41
Wounded Soldier:I'm under the direct command of Knight Commander Leonhardt and have undergone extensive training.I can handle a bit more than the average person, so you don't need to worry. #line:ch5soldierevent2_42
Emma:Directly under Knight Commander you say... #line:ch5soldierevent2_43
Wounded Soldier:Is something amiss? #line:ch5soldierevent2_44
Emma:Earlier, I mentioned that we're here to seek some answers from the Knights. #line:ch5soldierevent2_45
Emma:From what the Cardano villagers shared, it seems the Knights have been involved in landslide restorations in the southeast forest. We're puzzled as to why the Knights would be taking part in such activities. #line:ch5soldierevent2_46

Emma:Sir, you mentioned you report directly to the Knight Commander. Typically, someone in your position wouldn't be in the field for such restoration tasks. And those injuries of yours? They don't resemble anything from restoration work; it's more like a wound from a weapon. #line:ch5soldierevent2_47
Wounded Soldier:Um... about that... #line:ch5soldierevent2_48
Soldier A:What's driving your curiosity? #line:ch5soldierevent2_49
Soldier A:We appreciate your help in saving him, but as members of the knighthood, there are matters we're cautious to share. #line:ch5soldierevent2_50
Emma:Well...To put it plainly, as I believe the Knight Commander's close aides would be informed. Our mission is to defeat a demon, specifically the Demon King, on behalf of Elrod Castle's King. This here is (PlayerName), a descendant of the legendary hero. #line:ch5soldierevent2_51
Soldier A:Wait. What? You guys are... #line:ch5soldierevent2_52
Soldier B:Is that young man (PlayerName)-Wagner? #line:ch5soldierevent2_53

Wounded Soldier:He does match the description from Commander Leonhardt, and the look of the fellowship... Oh yeah, that's right...But he appears more ordinary and youthful than I'd imagined. #line:ch5soldierevent2_54
Emma:I'm relieved you seem convinced. #line:ch5soldierevent2_55
Emma:Now, what's the real situation in the forest near here? It can't just be about a landslide, right? We might be of assistance if you're honest with us. #line:ch5soldierevent2_56
Wounded Soldier:... That southeast forest? It's now a hotbed for intense battles against powerful demons. #line:ch5soldierevent2_57
Emma:What? #line:ch5soldierevent2_58
Wounded Soldier:Historically, that region was known for spawning unusually powerful demons, and in recent years, their emergence has become frequent. With the awakening of the Demon King, the onslaught of these mighty demons intensified. Our Knight Commander's squad was dispatched to combat this threat. #line:ch5soldierevent2_59
Emma:So, you lied to the villagers with the landslide story to keep them away from the forest. #line:ch5soldierevent2_60
Wounded Soldier:Indeed. Initially, we assumed wiping out one large group would end the threat. Yet, wave after wave of demons kept coming which made the battles for the long haul. #line:ch5soldierevent2_61
Wounded Soldier:You mentioned the villagers of Cardano speaking about the landslide...With the region being off-limits for so long, their suspicions are naturally growing. #line:ch5soldierevent2_62
Soldier A:Hiding the truth is becoming increasingly difficult, and there are whispers of relocating the villagers to safer areas. #line:ch5soldierevent2_63
Emma:We were not aware the situation was deteriorating to such an extent... #line:ch5soldierevent2_64
Soldier B:While we have a makeshift medical camp in the forest, it's overwhelmed with injured soldiers from the prolonged conflict. Hence, we were directed to bring him to Cardano's clinic immediately for care and recuperation. #line:ch5soldierevent2_65
Soldier B:At this rate, even Commander Leonhardt might reach the breaking point. #line:ch5soldierevent2_66
Emma:Given these circumstances, we should hurry to assist them. #line:ch5soldierevent2_67

Soldier A:I'll lead you to the entrance of the forest. We have guards stationed there, allowing only members of our Order to pass. It'll be smoother if I accompany you and clarify the situation. #line:ch5soldierevent2_68
Emma:I see, we appreciate it. #line:ch5soldierevent2_69
