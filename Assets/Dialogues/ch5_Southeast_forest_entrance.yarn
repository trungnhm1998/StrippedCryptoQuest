Soldier A:Greetings, you're doing well on your watch. #line:ch5groundarrival1_1
Soldier A:These individuals trace their lineage to the legendary heroes and are here under the King's command. Make sure they have unhindered access and inform other guards to do the same. #line:ch5groundarrival1_2
Guard on Duty:Really? Descendants of the legendary heroes... Understood! Proceed! #line:ch5groundarrival1_3

Soldier A:You should have no issues passing through from now on. #line:ch5groundarrival1_4
Soldier A:I'll brief Commander Leonhardt first; you can join us shortly after. #line:ch5groundarrival1_5

Encampment Soldier:I haven't seen your faces around here before. #line:ch5groundarrival2_3
Encampment Soldier:Don't tell me you wandered in here without proper authorization? #line:ch5groundarrival2_4
Encampment Soldier:No unauthorized personnel are allowed here! #line:ch5groundarrival2_5
Emma:No,no,no, we have the appropriate permissions to be here. #line:ch5groundarrival2_6
Encampment Soldier:Really? You youngsters? You're kidding me, right? #line:ch5groundarrival2_7
Encampment Soldier:Yea...This isn't a playground for the young. #line:ch5groundarrival2_8
Encampment Soldier:This area is dangerous. Leave at once, before you get hurt. #line:ch5groundarrival2_9
Bravo:What? The audacity to speak to my master like that... #line:ch5groundarrival2_10
Emma:Calm down, Bravo. We already have our hands full with the demons. Let's not cause a scene here. This is an establishment under the Knight Commander. If we explain ourselves clearly, they should understand. #line:ch5groundarrival2_11
Bravo:Are you sure? They don't seem to be understanding, do they? #line:ch5groundarrival2_12
Bravo:Look at them, they look kind of stupid and maybe the lowest of the lowest ranking,  wouldn't you say? #line:ch5groundarrival2_13
Emma:...Indeed, this feels somewhat tense... #line:ch5groundarrival2_14
Emma:B....But we still need to clarify, right? #line:ch5groundarrival2_15
Encampment Soldier:Hey! We're right here, we can hear everything! #line:ch5groundarrival2_16
Encampment Soldier:You're seriously picking a fight with us? #line:ch5groundarrival2_17
Encampment Soldier:Understand this â€“ we serve directly under Knight Commander Leonhardt! #line:ch5groundarrival2_18
Emma:Uh-oh, they heard every word! #line:ch5groundarrival2_19
Emma:Wow! Wait, wait, wait, calm down, brothers, I'm sorry, but we're really....! #line:ch5groundarrival2_20
???:The descendant of the legendary hero and his friends. They're on a quest to defeat the demons, ordered by our very own King, and they've come here for that very reason. #line:ch5groundarrival2_21

Encampment Soldier:Com...Commander Leonhardt!? #line:ch5groundarrival2_23

Leonhardt:You seem to be the newer recruits here. #line:ch5groundarrival2_24
Leonhardt:While it's commendable to be vigilant about outsiders, I must say your conduct doesn't align with the principles of knighthood. Be mindful of your behavior henceforth. #line:ch5groundarrival2_25
Encampment Soldiers:Ye..Yes. Understood! #line:ch5groundarrival2_26
Leonhardt:If a dispute arises, handle it under your own name. If you were directly under my command, I doubt such trivial quarrels would occur. #line:ch5groundarrival2_27
Leonhardt:I'll take it from here with this party. Return to your designated positions. #line:ch5groundarrival2_28
Encampment Soldiers:Ye....Yes. Of Course! #line:ch5groundarrival2_29

Leonhardt:I apologize for the behavior of my soldiers. #line:ch5groundarrival2_30
Emma:Ah, the renowned Knight Commander! It's an honor to meet you so soon. #line:ch5groundarrival2_31

Leonhardt:Formalities still dictate the sharing of names, regardless of one's reputation. #line:ch5groundarrival2_32
Leonhardt:Allow me to reintroduce myself. I am Leonhardt, Knight Commander of Elrod Castle. #line:ch5groundarrival2_33
Leonhardt:I've been informed about the incident at the Cardano clinic. First and foremost, thank you for assisting and saving the life of one of our soldiers. #line:ch5groundarrival2_34

Leonhardt:So, you must be (PlayerName), the heir to the legendary hero. #line:ch5groundarrival2_35
Leonhardt:...Many tales have been told, and indeed, you bear a striking resemblance to that person... #line:ch5groundarrival2_36
Emma:What? What did you say? #line:ch5groundarrival2_37
Leonhardt:No, it's nothing. #line:ch5groundarrival2_38
Leonhardt:My subordinate also mentioned your intention to join us on this front. Is that true? #line:ch5groundarrival2_39
===

Leonhardt:Indeed, as my subordinate may have conveyed, our forces are stretched thin. We're losing both numbers and the caliber of fighters needed for this battle. #line:ch5groundarrival2_40
Leonhardt:Your presence here truly offers a glimmer of hope in these trying times. #line:ch5groundarrival2_41

Leonhardt:...However, as it stands, I hesitate to request your assistance right now. #line:ch5groundarrival2_42
Emma:Wait, what? But you're in dire need of fighters, aren't you? #line:ch5groundarrival2_43
Leonhardt:Undoubtedly, with the lineage of a legendary hero, your prowess in both swordsmanship and magic likely surpasses many of our own. #line:ch5groundarrival2_44
Emma:Exactly! His abilities are very strong! #line:ch5groundarrival2_45
Leonhardt:...Yet, that's precisely the extent of my perception of you right now. #line:ch5groundarrival2_46
Leonhardt:While you are stronger than the others, currently, your strength might be on par with mine, at most. #line:ch5groundarrival2_47
Emma:So, that's not good enough? #line:ch5groundarrival2_48
Leonhardt:The General Ogre leads a horde of demons on this battleground. #line:ch5groundarrival2_49
Leonhardt:Drawing power directly from the Demon King, his strength is unique and unparalleled among his demonic kin. #line:ch5groundarrival2_50
Leonhardt:Given our current strength, combined with yours, our chances of defeating General Ogre and his horde are 50-50....Perhaps even less than that. #line:ch5groundarrival2_51
Emma:Yet, if there's even a glimmer of hope, I'll bet on us... #line:ch5groundarrival2_52
Leonhardt:Your ultimate goal is to vanquish the Demon King and rescue the princess. If you fail or barely succeed here, how do you plan to face foes even more formidable than General Ogre? #line:ch5groundarrival2_53
Emma:Ye...Yes, the Knight Commander speaks the truth... #line:ch5groundarrival2_54
Leonhardt:Up until now, perhaps your method has worked, but this time requires a different approach. #line:ch5groundarrival2_55
Leonhardt:Earlier, I mentioned 'you right now' repeatedly. Do you grasp its significance? #line:ch5groundarrival2_56

Leonhardt:...(PlayerName), there lies dormant within you an immense power yet to be awakened. #line:ch5groundarrival2_57
Leonhardt:While you might surpass many and rival me, the Knight Commander, there's a unique and special power within you that's incomparable. #line:ch5groundarrival2_58
Emma:Special power...? #line:ch5groundarrival2_59
===
title: ch5_battle_ground_arrival2_12

Leonhardt:Such power definitely resides in you. It's crucial that you unlock it. #line:ch5groundarrival2_60
Leonhardt:Not merely as the descendant of a legendary hero but to truly claim the mantle of a hero yourself. #line:ch5groundarrival2_61
Emma:But how do you expect him to suddenly awaken such power? #line:ch5groundarrival2_62
Emma:Knight Commander, if you're pressing this point, you must have some insight, right? #line:ch5groundarrival2_63
Leonhardt:...Sadly, my vision only goes this far. #line:ch5groundarrival2_64
Emma:So, after sharing all this, it's a bit surprising you don't have the answers... #line:ch5groundarrival2_65
Leonhardt:I, too, don't have complete knowledge of everything. #line:ch5groundarrival2_66
Leonhardt:Being a direct descendant of the legendary hero, mere rigorous training might not suffice. The Great Church should have texts about the Legendary Hero. #line:ch5groundarrival2_67
Emma:Understood. We'll ask the Archbishop then. #line:ch5groundarrival2_68

Emma:But will you and the Knights manage in the meantime? The situation here sounds dire. #line:ch5groundarrival2_69
Leonhardt:Your very presence, as the heir to the legendary hero, will undoubtedly uplift the spirits of the Knights. With hope on our side, we can persevere. #line:ch5groundarrival2_70

Leonhardt:So you'll harness this greater power and return to aid us... I see.. #line:ch5groundarrival2_71
Leonhardt:I regret having to ask this of you after you've journeyed so far, but for the future battles, please understand. When you return, I hope to witness the true might of the Legendary Hero within you. #line:ch5groundarrival2_72

Leonhardt:My men await. I must take my leave. #line:ch5groundarrival2_73
Emma:The Knight Commander is very busy. #line:ch5groundarrival2_74
Emma:Our next destination should be the Great Church. We need to unlock that latent power quickly and return here. #line:ch5groundarrival2_75
Leonhardt:Yes, I'll be anticipating your return. #line:ch5groundarrival2_76

Leonhardt:...He looked a lot like that man.... #line:ch5groundarrival2_77
Leonhardt:I'm sure he will awaken his hidden powers and come back to us soon. #line:ch5groundarrival2_78
