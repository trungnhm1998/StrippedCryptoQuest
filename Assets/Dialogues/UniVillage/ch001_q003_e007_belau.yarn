Berau: I see... I travel just for my own enjoyment, but you're traveling and helping people at the same time. #line:0b5985e
Berau: ...That's amazing! Not everyone can do that! #line:0cde39a

Berau: Hey, meeting in a small village like this must be fate. Let me support your journey of helping others, even if it's just a little! #line:0e8a567
Berau: I can't fight like you, but I collect beautiful and rare things on my travels. Maybe something I've found could be useful for your journey! #line:0974925
Berau: What do I have right now... Oh, this looks good! Please take it! #line:051497d

Berau: You look like you're wondering if that's really a fair exchange. #line:0ac9391
Berau: You see, like I said earlier, the kind of journey you're on, helping people, it's not something just anyone can do. #line:0f7544e
Berau: On a journey like yours, you'll encounter people, things, and scenes that I or others on their travels would never come across. #line:049af2f
Berau: Such experiences... they're invaluable, something you can't buy with money or replace with anything. #line:0ac0907
Berau: ...So, do you see it now? Your travel stories are really valuable to me! #line:085387c
