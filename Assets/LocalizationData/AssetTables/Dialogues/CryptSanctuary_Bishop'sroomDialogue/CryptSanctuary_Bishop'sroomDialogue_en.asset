      for seven days as all light was absorbed.

      I... Yes, it is very close to the room where the Archbishop collapsed. If you
      ask me what I was doing, I was just walking there...Well...I was just looking
      at the view from the window and thinking how beautiful this island is. Is that
      all you have to ask? Then I'll go back to praying. Now I pray every day for
      the Archbishop's speedy recovery.
