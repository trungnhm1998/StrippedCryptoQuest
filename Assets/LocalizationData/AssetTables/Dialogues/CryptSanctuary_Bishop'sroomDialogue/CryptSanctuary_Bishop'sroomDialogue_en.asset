    m_Localized: Roman:Upon witnessing the horrifying transformation of his daughter,
      the Saint was consumed by a mix of profound sorrow, rage, and desperation.
      To confront the Witch, he harnessed pure light, crafting the 'Ring of Destruction'
      from it. Legends say that during its creation, the world was plunged into darkness
      for seven days as all light was absorbed.
