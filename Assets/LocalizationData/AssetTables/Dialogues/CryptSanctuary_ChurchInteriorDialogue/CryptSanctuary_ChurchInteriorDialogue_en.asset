      there's a lake close to the Lost Forest. Second, a lake situated on an island
      in the desert continent where the dead is worshipped. Third, although not a
      lake, there's a spring near the Elrod Castle. These are our best bets for now.
      If we investigate these sites, chances are we'll find the legendary water in
      one of them, right?
